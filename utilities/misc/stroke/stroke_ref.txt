Note for Coverdell users: Based upon the recommendations of PCNSAR clinical consultants, PCNAST does not require hospitals to include patients who are observation patients in the registry.

Included:

Patients initially admitted to the hospital for one of the diagnoses even if they later transfer or expire.
Patients directly admitted to nursing units within the hospital without first being seen in the Emergency Department (ED). This includes patients with acute ischemic stroke who receive treatment at another hospital and are transferred to your hospital.
Patients who refuse treatment or who have Do Not Resuscitate orders.
Patients evaluated and treated in the ED with the intention of being admitted, even if they expire, leave against medical advice, or are subsequently transferred to another acute care hospital prior to being admitted to the hospital (this would include patients that receive IV tPA at your hospital and are then transferred for further management ("drip and ship patients").
Optional:

Patients who have an in-hospital stroke. Please note in-hospital strokes are excluded from all Achievement Measures, but are included in the GWTG Inpatient stroke measures.
Patients who present with stroke-like symptoms but who do not end up being diagnosed with a stroke or TIA (stroke mimics).
Patients evaluated, treated, and discharged from the ED (with no inpatient admission) to home or another location that is not an acute care hospital.
Patients discharged from observation status with no inpatient admission.
Patients admitted for the sole purpose of the performance of elective carotid endarterectomy or any revascularization. This type of patient would typically be excluded from GWTG-Stroke. Only enter this type of patient if needed to comply with TJC (or other) sampling plan or data entry requirements.
Exclude:

Patients < 18 years of age.

REQUIRED: Final clinical diagnosis related to stroke

This field is used to define patient populations in the Get With The Guidelines® Stroke Measures and is the stroke or TIA diagnosis documented by a physician following and evaluation of the patient. The Final clinical diagnosis related to stroke (stroke or TIA diagnosis) may be a principal or secondary diagnosis assigned at discharge. The options for this element are:

Ischemic stroke
Transient ischemic attack
Subarachnoid hemorrhage
Intracerebral hemorrhage
Stroke not otherwise specified
No stroke related diagnosis
Elective Carotid Intervention only
Refer to Entry Criteria for a list of the diagnosis codes used to describe these diagnoses.

Notes for Abstraction:

For most cases the Final Clinical diagnosis related to stroke will be equivalent to the principal diagnosis code. However, for some cases such as in-patient or in-hospital stroke or TIA the principal diagnosis code and the Final diagnosis related to stroke will differ. The Final diagnosis related to stroke can be the principal or secondary diagnosis assigned at discharge. Refer to the definition of principal diagnosis below for additional information.
For patients whose symptoms resolve upon arrival to ED, but then return later during the hospitalization (symptoms > 24hrs or infarction on brain imaging while an inpatient) select ‘ischemic stroke’. For the element Patient location when stroke symptoms discovered select ‘stroke occurred after hospital arrival (in ED/Obs/inpatient)’.
For patients who arrive with symptoms of stroke and have complete resolution after IV tPA select ‘ischemic stroke’. These cases are sometimes referred to as "aborted stroke".
For patients admitted with ischemic stroke who are treated with IV tPA or other medications and develop the complication of intracerebral hemorrhage select ‘ischemic stroke’. If a patient is transferred to your hospital for management of a hemorrhagic complication after treatment with IV tPA for an ischemic stroke at the referring hospital select ‘ischemic stroke’ as this is the stroke diagnosis that initially lead to the patient’s hospitalization.
For patients admitted for non-stroke related illness, but who experience a stroke after admission select the stroke diagnosis documented by the physician. These in-patient/in-hospital stroke cases are optional for the Get With the Guidelines registry; they are included in the Get With the Guidelines Inpatient Stroke measures, but  excluded from Get With the Guidelines Achievement measures. For the element Patient location when stroke symptoms discovered select ‘stroke occurred after hospital arrival (in ED/Obs/inpatient)’.
Patients who present with neurological symptoms, but after work-up are determined not to have suffered from a stroke or TIA, are not required to be entered into the PMT. Select ‘no stroke related diagnosis’ when:
The patient presents with stroke mimic or a stroke-like clinical picture and IV tPA is initiated, but the final clinical diagnosis is later determined not to be stroke related. You can report the stroke mimic or stroke-line diagnosis (e.g., migraine, seizure) in the subsequent data element “If No Stroke Related Diagnosis”. This allows hospitals to track outcomes of the relatively small number of patients who appeared to be having a stroke and were treated with IV tPA, but later turned out to have a stroke mimic.
The patient presents with stroke mimic or a stroke-like clinical presentation and a ‘stroke code’ is activated and/or the patient is followed by the stroke service until the stroke diagnosis is ruled out. Also complete the subsequent data element “If No Stroke Related Diagnosis”.
Patients who are found to have incidentally discovered infarcts (silent, subclinical, or prior CNS infarction) are not required to be entered into the tool.
For patients who are documented as having "CVA" or "Stroke" in their medical record, without any additional documentation regarding the stroke type and who have no evidence of hemorrhage on initial brain imaging select  ‘ischemic stroke’.
For patients whom there is evidence of both ischemic injury and brain hemorrhage on initial imaging select "stroke not otherwise specified."
Patients who present with symptoms that are not recognized as having been caused by stroke while in the initial phase of their hospital care, but are determined ultimately to have had a stroke or TIA select the stroke or TIA diagnosis documented by the physician.
Select “Elective Carotid Intervention only” for patients with documentation that demonstrates that the current admission is solely for the performance of an elective carotid intervention (e.g., elective carotid endarterectomy, angioplasty, carotid stenting). This option has been added for sites that are entering patients admitted for the performance of an elective carotid intervention because the patient falls into their TJC/CM sampling plan. If this diagnosis is selected, only those data elements required by TJC for this patient population will be required to save the form as complete. Do not select this option for patients that present with an acute stroke event.
Example: Patient 060a was admitted with pneumonia. On hospital day 2 patient developed right sided weakness and was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Final clinical diagnosis related to stroke = "Ischemic Stroke."

Admission Data, Hospitalization Data

Summary of Changes

OPTIONAL: If No Stroke Related Diagnosis

If “Final clinical diagnosis related to stroke” is “No Stroke Related Diagnosis”, select the final non-stroke related diagnosis. This is the final diagnosis defined in the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) as "that condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care." and not the suspected diagnosis at the time of admission. Select the patient's diagnosis based on the clinical information found in the medical record. If uncertain, consult ICD-9-CM diagnosis code.

Migraine: Includes physician documentation that the neurological symptoms mimicking stroke were caused by migraine (migraine headache, classic or common migraine, migraine with or without aura, status migrainosus) that could include discharges with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 346.0-346.93.
Seizure: Includes physician documentation that the neurological symptoms mimicking stroke were caused by seizure or convulsion that could include discharges with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 345: Epilepsy, 780.3: Convulsions, 780.33: Post traumatic seizures, 780.39: Other convulsions.
Delirium: Includes physician documentation that the neurological symptoms mimicking stroke were caused by delirium attributed to any cause (e.g. alcohol or sedative drug withdrawal, drug abuse, electrolyte or other body chemical disturbances, infections etc.)
Electrolyte or metabolic imbalance: Includes physician documentation that the neurological symptoms mimicking stroke were caused by hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism or other electrolyte or metabolic disturbance.
Functional disorder: Includes physician documentation that neurological symptoms were the result of a conversion or functional disorder that could include discharges with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 300.11: Conversion Disorder. Functional Disorder and conversion disorder are terms that may be used interchangeably. A conversion disorder is a condition in which patients present with neurological symptoms such as numbness, blindness, or paralysis without a neurological cause.
Other: Final clinical diagnosis is determined not to be stroke related, but the specific diagnosis is something other than those provided. This could include ICD-9 codes such as 780.4; Dizziness and giddiness, 784.3; Aphasia; 784.5; Other speech disturbance; 784.51; Dysarthria, 787.2; Dysphagia780.97; Altered mental status 386.1 and 386.10: Peripheral vertigo (this list is not all inclusive).
Uncertain: Final clinical diagnosis is determined not to be stroke related but the cause of the patient’s symptoms is not confirmed or unknown at the time of discharge.
Notes for abstraction:

This data element can be used to capture the final diagnosis for those patients in whom stroke was initially suspected but after complete clinical work-up were determined not to have had a stroke. You can choose to enter patients with no stroke related diagnosis if:
The patient presents with stroke mimic or a stroke-like clinical picture and IV tPA is initiated, but after neuroimaging studies and further work-up the final clinical diagnosis is later determined not to be stroke related.
The patient presents with stroke mimic or a stroke-like clinical presentation and a stroke code is activated and/or the patient is followed by the stroke service until the stroke diagnosis is ruled out.
This assignment of diagnosis should be done independently of the ICD-9-CM code assigned. However, the diagnosis selected here should ideally be equivalent to the final ICD-9-CM code. In circumstances when another ICD-9-CM code has been chosen and there is a discrepancy, please consult your local Stroke Champion or Stroke Team lead and/or the hospital administrator responsible for assigning ICD-9 codes.
These patients will be excluded from all Get With The Guidelines measures
Summary of Changes

REQUIRED: Was an etiology documented in the patient medical records as the most likely cause of ischemic stroke?

Yes: There is clear documentation by a physician, nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant in the patient medical record indicating that apotential underlying cause(s) of ischemic stroke was identified. This option should be selected when there is evidence in the medical record that the stroke etiology was investigated, even if no cause was identified despite the investigation or if multiple potential causes were identified.

Remember that there can never be absolute certainty about etiology, since it is always an assumption about the likelihood of an association between the cause (ischemic stroke risk factor) and effect (ischemic stroke).

No: The documentation by a physician, nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant in the patient medical record does not address the potential cause of the ischemic stroke. Select No if sufficient diagnostic tests were not performed to identify a potential cause. If multiple etiologies are listed on admission but no synthesis of the results of the workup is provided, then no presumptive etiology is available. You would check No in this case.

Diagnostic statements such as CVA, stroke, cerebral embolism, MCA stroke do not describe a cause of potential cause. If diagnostic evaluation to investigate a cause(s) was not performed then select No.

Ischemic Stroke Etiology: If there is one cause identified as the most likely etiology, select that one choice. You should only select a specific etiology (e.g., Cardioembolic) if the medical record indicates that the treating provider believed this to be a possible mechanism. If the etiology is uncertain between two or more possible causes, select Cryptogenic Stroke and Multiple potential etiologies identified. Do not include etiologies that were identified initially as possibilities which were not later confirmed. If you are uncertain as to which etiology to select, check with your stroke physician champion.

1: Large-artery atherosclerosis: Significant stenosis or occlusion (>50%) due to atherosclerosis of any of the following major artery segments was identified: common or internal carotid artery (ICA); proximal middle (MCA), anterior or posterior cerebral artery (ACA or PCA); vertebral or basilar artery. This option also includes atherosclerosis of the aortic arch and its great vessel origins: the brachiocephalic and subclavian arteries.

2: Cardioembolism: A cardiac condition was identified as a high risk source of cerebral embolism. Possible heart conditions include atrial fibrillation/flutter, mitral valve stenosis, prosthetic or bioprosthetic heart valve, left ventricular assist device, acute or recent myocardial infarction with mural thrombus, endocarditis and cardiac tumors.

3: Small-vessel disease: Disease of small intracerebral arterial vessels was identified as cause of ischemic stroke. Imaging reveals an acute small vessel territory infarct <1.5 cm in the appropriate location (e.g. subcortical or brain stem lacunar infarction) or a classic clinical lacunar syndrome is present and imaging excludes non-lacunar etiology.

4: Stroke of other determined etiology: Select this option when an uncommon causes of ischemic stroke has been identified, including but not limited to, arterial dissection, vasculitis, hypercoagulable disorders, sickle cell anemia, migraine-associated, mitochondrial disorders (e.g., MELAS), or genetic causes of stroke. Also select Dissection or Hypercoagulability as the cause when appropriate. Select Other if another cause of the stroke has been identified (e.g., vasculopathy).

Dissection: Select this option when arterial dissection was identified as the cause of the stroke.
Hypercoagulability: Select this option when a hypercoagulable disorder was identified as the cause of stroke.
Other: Select this option when another cause which is neither dissection nor hypercoagulabiity is identified as the cause of stroke.
5: Cryptogenic stroke: A potential cause of stroke was not identified following thorough diagnostic evaluation: This includes a diagnosis of undetermined cause following diagnostic evaluation. Select this option only if testing to determine stroke etiology has been performed and does not confirm a likely cause or when multiple potential etiologies are identified. For most strokes, this includes cardiac ultrasound, extracranial arterial vessel imaging (carotid artery ultrasound, CTA or MRA). Patients with an undetermined cause of stroke (cryptogenic stroke) often have one or more risk factors of uncertain significance such as patent foramen ovale (PFO), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, mitral annulus calcification, atrial or ventricular arrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation or flutter. The role of these risk factors in the cause of stroke is uncertain. Also select one of the below options to report additional information regarding the cause or potential causes:

Multiple potential etiologies identified: Select this option when following diagnostic evaluation, a single etiology is uncertain between two or more possible causes.
Stroke of undetermined etiology: Select this option when a potential etiology was not identified or documented following diagnostic evaluation.
Unspecified: Select this option when there is no documentation of the results of the diagnostic evaluation.
Examples:

Final diagnosis is "ischemic stroke"; atrial fibrillation documented in medical history section of medical record, but there is no documentation of a diagnostic workup or underlying cause of the ischemic stroke. Because there is no documentation stating atrial fibrillation or other condition as underlying cause and no diagnostic workup, select No for Was an etiology documented in the patient medical record as the most likely cause of stroke?
Final diagnosis "ischemic stroke presumably due to atrial fibrillation"; cardiac ultrasound and cardiac monitoring tests performed. In this example diagnostic tests were performed and atrial fibrillation was stated as the most likely underlying cause for stroke. Select Yes for Was an etiology documented in the patient medical record as the most likely cause of stroke? and Cardioembolism as the stroke etiology.
Final diagnosis is "ischemic stroke"; carotid ultrasound shows ICA occlusion (approx. 60% occlusion). Because there is no documentation stating ICA occlusion as the underlying cause of the stroke, select No for Was an etiology documented in the patient medical record as the most likely cause of stroke?
Final diagnosis is "ischemic stroke, cause unknown"; no diagnostic test performed. Select Yes for Was an etiology documented in the patient medical record as the most likely cause of stroke? Select Cryptogenic Stroke and Stroke of undetermined etiology for the stroke etiology.
Final diagnosis is "ischemic stroke" and work up reveals both carotid occlusion and atrial fibrillation as potential causes. Select Cryptogenic Stroke and Multiple potential etiologies identified.
Summary of Changes

REQUIRED: When is the earliest documentation of comfort measures only?

Indicate if there is any evidence that the patient's care was restricted to "Comfort Measures Only".

Day 0 or 1
Day 2 or after
Timing unclear
Not Documented/UTD
Physician/advanced practice nurse/physician assistant (physician/APN/PA) documentation of comfort measures only. Commonly referred to as "comfort care" in the medical community and "comfort care" by the general public. Comfort care includes attention to the psychological and spiritual needs of the patient and support for the dying patient and the patient's family. Comfort Measures Only are not equivalent to the following: Do Not Resuscitate (DNR), living will, no code, no heroic measure, or a physician order to withhold emergency resuscitative measures such as Do Not Resuscitate.

Day 0 or 1: The earliest day the physician/APN/PA documented comfort measures only was the day of arrival (Day 0) or day after arrival (Day 1).
Day 2 or after: The earliest day the physician/APN/PA documented comfort mesures was two or more days after arrival day (Day +2).
Timing unclear: There is physician/APN/PA documentation of comfort measures only during this hospital stay, but whether the earliest documentation of comfort measures only was on day 0 or 1 OR after day 1 is unclear.
Not documented/UTD: There is no physician/APN/PA documentation of comfort measures only, or unable to determine from medical record information.
Notes for Abstraction:

Only accept terms identified in the list of inclusions. No other terminology will be accepted.
Physician/APN/PA documentation of comfort measures only (hospice, comfort care, etc.) mentioned in the following contexts suffices:
Comfort measures only recommendation
Order for consultation or evaluation by a hospice care service
Patient or family request for comfort measures only
Plan for comfort measures only
Referral to hospice care service
Determine the earliest day the physician/APN/PA DOCUMENTED comfort measures only in the ONLY ACCEPTABLE SOURCES. Do not factor in when comfort measures only was actually instituted
Examples
"Discussed comfort care with family on arrival" noted in day 2 progress note - Select "Day 2 of After."
POLST order for comfort care dated prior to arrival - Select "Day 0 or 1."
If any of the inclusions are documented in the ONLY ACCEPTABLE SOURCES, select "1," "2," or "3" accordingly, unless otherwise specified in this data element.
Consider comfort measures only documentation in the discharge summary as documentation on the last day of the hospitalization, regardless of when the summary is dictated.
Documentation of an Inclusion term in the following situations should be disregarded. Continue to review the remainder of the ONLY ACCEPTABLE SOURCES for acceptable Inclusion terms. If the ONLY documentation found is an Inclusion term in the following situations, select “not documented/UTD”:
Documentation that is dated prior to arrival or documentation which refers to the pre-arrival time period (e.g., comfort measures only order in previous hospitalization record, "Pt. on hospice at home" in MD ED note).
EXCEPTION: State-authorized portable orders (SAPOs). SAPOs are specialized forms, Out-of-Hospital DNR (OOH DNR) or Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) orders, or identifiers authorized by state law, that translate a patient's preferences about specific-end-of-life treatment decisions into portable medical orders. Examples: 
DNR-Comfort Care form
MOLST (Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment)
POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment)
Pre-printed order forms signed by the physician/APN/PA:

Disregard an Inclusion term in a statement that is not part of the order or that is not clearly selected (on a form that offers options to select from).

Examples:
Inclusion term used only in the title of the form (e.g., "DNR-Comfort Care" form, option "Comfort Care" is not checked)

Inclusion term used only in the pre-printed instruction for completing the form (e.g. "Copy of form to hospice", "Instructions" section of the form further defines the option "Comfort Care")

If there is a specific option for “Comfort Measures Only” (or other Inclusion term) that is unchecked, then disregard documentation on that form, regardless of whether that Inclusion term might be used in a different option that is checked.
Example: POLST form - The "Limited Additional Interventions" option checked is described as "In addition to care described in Comfort Measures Only, use medical treatment, antibiotics, ..."
Inclusion term clearly described as negative.
Examples:
"No comfort care"
"Not a hospice candidate"
"Not appropriate for hospice care"
"I offered hospice care consult to discuss end of life issues. Family did not show any interest."
"Patient declines hospice care at this time but I feel this will be an important plan of care when his condition deteriorates further"
"Comfort care would also be reasonable - defer decision for now"
Comfort measures made conditional upon whether or not the patient arrests. Examples:
DNRCCA" (Do Not Resuscitate - Comfort Care Arrest)
Comfort Care Protocol will be implemented in the event of a cardiac arrest or a respiratory arrest"
Family requests comfort measures only should the patient arrest"
Documentation of "CMO" should be disregarded if documentation makes clear it is not being used as an acronym for Comfort Measures Only (e.g., "hx dilated CMO" - Cardiomyopathy context).
If there is documentation of an Inclusion term clearly described as negative in one source and an Inclusion term NOT described as negative in another source, that second source would still count for comfort measures only.

Examples:
On Day 0 the physician documents “The patient is not a hospice candidate.” On Day 3, the physician orders a hospice consult. Select “2”.

On Day 1 the physician documents the patient is comfort measures only. On Day 2 the physician documents “The patient is refusing CMO.” Select “1”.
For inpatient strokes, assess earliest documentation of comfort measures only from date/time of discovery of stroke symptoms. If comfort measures was instituted prior to the date/time of discovery of stroke symptoms, select "Day 1 or 2".
Example: Patient 070 arrived to the hospital on 4/1/2012 and was admitted the same day for acute MI. On 4/3/2012 the nurse finds the patient unable to speak and unable to move his right side. The stroke team is consulted and it is determine that the patient had an ischemic stroke. The neurologist orders a consultation for hospice care services on 4/4/2012. Select "Day 1 or 2" as the day of discovery of stroke symptoms (4/3/2012) is day 1 for inpatient strokes.

REQUIRED: Arrival Date/Time (Date & time of arrival to this Hospital)

Element definition from Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures

The earliest documented month, day, and year, and time the patient arrived at the hospital.

MM = Month (01-12)
DD = Day (01-31)
YYYY = Year (20XX)
HH = Hour (00-23)
MM = Minutes (00-59)
UTD = Unable to Determine
Time must be recorded in military time format.

With the exception of Midnight and Noon:

If the time is in the a.m., conversion is not required
If the time is in the p.m., add 12 to the clock time hour
Examples:

Midnight - 00:00, Noon - 12:00
5:31 am - 05:31, 5:31 pm - 17:31
11:59 am - 11:59, 11:59 pm - 23:59
Note: 00:00 = midnight. If the time is documented as 00:00 11-24- 20XX , review supporting documentation to determine if the Arrival Date should remain 11-24- 20XX or if it should be converted to 11-25- 20XX .

When converting Midnight or 24:00 to 00:00 do not forget to change the Arrival Date.

Example: Midnight or 24:00 on 11-24- 20XX = 00:00 on 11-25- 20XX

Notes for Abstraction (Date/Time):

If the date/time of arrival is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select "UTD."
For times that include “seconds”, remove the seconds and record the time as is.
Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at "face value"). When the date/time documented is obviously in error (not a valid format/range or outside of the parameters of care [after the Discharge Date ]) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select "UTD." 
Examples Date:
Documentation indicates the Arrival Date was 03- 42 -20XX . No other documentation in the list of Only Acceptable Sources provides a valid date. Since the Arrival Date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for "Day", it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select "UTD."
Patient expires on 02-12-20XX and all documentation within the Only Acceptable Sources indicates the Arrival Date was 03-12-20XX. Other documentation in the medical record supports the date of death as being accurate. Since the Arrival Date is after the Discharge Date (death), it is outside of the parameter of care and the abstractor should select "UTD."
Examples Time:
Documentation indicates the Arrival Time was 3300. No other documentation in the list of Only Acceptable Sources provides a valid time. Since the Arrival Time is outside of the range in the Allowable Values for “Hour,” it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select “UTD”.
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the CMS Clinical Warehouse and the Joint Commission's Data Warehouse. Use of "UTD" for Arrival Date/Time allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
Review the Only Acceptable Sources to determine the earliest date/time the patient arrived at the ED, nursing floor, or observation, or as a direct admit to the cath lab. The intent is to utilize any documentation which reflects processes that occurred in the ED or after arrival to the nursing floor/observation/cath lab for a direct admit.
Documentation outside of the Only Acceptable Sources list should NOT be referenced (e.g., ambulance record, physician office record, H&P).
Examples:
ED Triage Date/Time 03-22-20xx 2355. ED rhythm strip dated/timed 03-23-20xx 0030. EMS report indicates patient was receiving EMS care from 0005 through 0025 on 03-23-20xx. The EMS report is disregarded. Enter 03-22-20xx for Arrival Date.
ED noted arrival time of 0100 on 04-14-20xx. Lab report shows blood culture collected at 2345 on 04-13-20xx. It is not clear that the blood culture was collected in the ED because the lab report does not specify it was collected in the ED (unable to confirm lab report as an Only Acceptable Source). Enter 04-14-20xx for Arrival Date.
ED Triage Date/Time 06-18-20xx 0025. EMS report indicates patient arrived by ambulance on 06-17-20xx 2355. Patient routed directly to CT. The EMS report is disregarded. Enter 06-18-20xx for Arrival Date.
ED Triage Time 0800. ED rhythm strip 0830. EMS report indicates patient was receiving EMS care from 0805 through 0825. The EMS report is disregarded. Enter 0800 for Arrival Time.
ED noted arrival time of 0945. Lab report shows blood culture collected at 0830. It is not clear that the blood culture was collected in the ED because the lab report does not specify it was collected in the ED (unable to confirm lab report as an Only Acceptable Source). Enter 0945 for Arrival Time.
ED Triage Time 1525. EMS report indicates patient was receiving care 1435 through 1455. ED report documents time of head CT 1505. The EMS report is disregarded. Enter 1505 for Arrival Time.

• Arrival date.time should NOT be abstracted simply as the earliest date in one of the Only Acceptable Sources, without regard to other substantiating documentation. When looking at the Only Acceptable Sources, if the earliest date documented appears to be an obvious error, this date should not be abstracted.
Examples:
ED arrival time noted as 0030 on 10-29-20xx. ED MAR shows an antibiotic administration time of 0100 on 10-28-20xx. Surrounding documentation on the ED MAR makes clear that the 10-28-20xx date is an obvious error - Date was not changed to 10-29-20xx. The antibiotic administration date/time would be converted to 0100 on 10-29-20xx. Enter 10-29-20xx for Arrival Date.
ED MAR shows an antibiotic administration time of 1430 on 11-03-20xx. All other dates in the ED record note 12-03-20xx. The antibiotic administration date of 11-03-20xx would not be used for Arrival Date because it is an obvious error.
ED ECG dated/timed as 05-07-20xx 2142. ED Greet Date/Time 05-08-20xx 0125. ED Triage Date/Time 05-08-20xx 0130. There is no documentation in the Only Acceptable Sources which suggests the 05-07-20xx is an obvious error. Enter 05-07-20xx for Arrival Date.
ED RN documents on a nursing triage note dated 04-24-20xx, “Blood culture collected at 2230.” ED arrival time is documented as 0130 on 04-25-20xx. There is no documentation in the Only Acceptable Sources which suggests the 04-24-20xx is an obvious error. Enter 04-24-20xx for Arrival Date.
ED arrival time noted as 2300 on 10-28-20xx. ED MAR shows an antibiotic
administration time of 0100 on 10-28-20xx. Surrounding documentation on the ED MAR makes clear that the 10-28-20xx date is an obvious error - Date was not
changed to 10-29-20xx. The antibiotic administration date/time would be
converted to 0100 on 10-29-20xx. Enter 2300 for Arrival Time.
ED face sheet lists arrival time of 13:20. ED Registration Time 13:25. ED Triage
Time 13:30. ED consent to treat form has 1:17 time but “AM” is circled. ED
record documentation suggests the 1:17 AM is an obvious error. Enter 13:20 for
Arrival Time.
ED ECG timed as 1742. ED Greet Time 2125. ED Triage Time 2130. There is no
documentation in the Only Acceptable Sources which suggests the 1742 is an
obvious error. Enter 1742 for Arrival Time.
In determining if there is documentation which suggests the patient was not in the hospital on a given date, sources outside of the Only Acceptable Sources list can be referenced. However, do not use dates described as hospital arrival on these sources for Arrival Date/Time.
Examples:
ED ECG dated/timed as 05-07-20xx 2142. ED Greet Date/Time 05-08-20xx 0125. ED Triage Date/Time 05-08-20xx 0130. EMS record shows patient was enroute at 05-08-20xx 0100. Enter 05-08-20xx for Arrival Date.
ED ECG timed as 1742. ED Greet Time 2125. ED Triage Time 2130. EMS record shows patient was enroute at 2100. Enter 2125 for Arrival Time.
ED face sheet noted arrival date/time as 02-27-20xx 2300. The first vitals are recorded at 02-28-20xx 0020. There is no documentation to support that the patient was not in the hospital on 02-27-200xx 2300. Enter 02-27-20xx for Arrival Date.
ED face sheet noted arrival time as 1000. The first vitals are recorded at 1120. There is no documentation to support that the patient was not in the hospital at 1000. Enter 1000 for Arrival Time.
ED Triage Date/Time 03-22-20xx 2355. ED rhythm strip dated/timed 03-23-20xx 0030. EMS report indicates patient was receiving EMS care from 0005 through 0025 on 03-23-20xx. Enter 03-23-20xx for Arrival Date.
ED Triage Date/Time 06-18-20xx 0025. EMS report indicates patient arrived by
ambulance on 06-17-20xx 2355. Patient routed directly to CT. The EMS report is
disregarded. Enter 06-18-20xx for Arrival Date.
The source "Emergency Department record" includes any documentation from the time period that the patient was an ED patient (e.g., ED face sheet, ED consent/Authorization for treatment forms, ED/Outpatient Registration/sign-in forms, ED vital sign record, ED triage record, ED physician orders, ED ECG reports, ED telemetry/rhythm strips, ED laboratory reports, ED x-ray reports, ED head CT scan, CTA, MRI, MRA reports).
The source “Procedure notes” refers to procedures such as cardiac caths, endoscopies, and surgical procedures. Procedure notes do not include ECG and x-ray reports.
The arrival date/time may differ from the admission date/time.
If the patient is in either an outpatient setting of the hospital other than observation status (e.g., dialysis, chemotherapy, cardiac cath) or a SNF unit of the hospital, and is subsequently admitted to acute inpatient, use the date/time the patient arrived at the ED or on the floor for acute inpatient care as the arrival date/time.
Observation status: 
If the patient was admitted to observation from an outpatient setting of the hospital, use the date/time the patient arrived at the ED or on the floor for observation care as the arrival date/time.
If the patient was admitted to observation from the ED of the hospital, use the date/time the patient arrived at the ED as the arrival date/time.
Direct Admits:
If the patient is a “Direct Admit” to the cath lab, use the earliest date/time the patient arrived at the cath lab (or cath lab staging/holding area) as the arrival date/time.
For “Direct Admits” to acute inpatient or observation, use the earliest date/time the patient arrived at the nursing floor or in observation (as documented in the Only Acceptable Sources) as the arrival date/time.
If the patient was transferred from your hospital’s satellite/free-standing ED or from another hospital within your hospital’s system (as an inpatient or ED patient), and there is one medical record for the care provided at both facilities, use the arrival date/time at the first facility.
CSTK Measures only EXCEPTION: Use the arrival date/time at the comprehensive stroke center.
For inpatient strokes, enter the actual hospital arrival date/time and not the date/time of symptom discovery (Note this is not from the definition from Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures).

Element definition from Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures

The month, day, and year of admission to acute inpatient care.

MM = Month (01-12)
DD = Day (01-31)
YYYY = Year (20xx)
Note: For CMS, only dates that are equal to or less than 120 days from the Discharge Date will be accepted into the CMS Clinical Warehouse.
Refer to the Data Transmission section of this manual for further guidance related to data transmission.

Notes for Abstraction:

The intent of this data element is to determine the date that the patient was actually admitted to acute inpatient care. Because this data element is critical in determining the population for all measures, the abstractor should NOT assume that the claim information for the admission date is correct. If the abstractor determines through chart review that the date from billing is incorrect, for purposes of abstraction, she/he should correct and override the downloaded value.
If using claim information, the ‘Statement Covers Period’ is not synonymous with the ‘Admission Date’ and should not be used to abstract this data element. These are two distinctly different identifiers:
The Admission Date is purely the date the patient was admitted as an inpatient to the facility.
The Statement Covers Period (“From” and “Through” dates) identifies the span of service dates included in a particular claim. The “From” Date is the earliest date of service on the claim.
For patients who are admitted to Observation status and subsequently admitted to acute inpatient care, abstract the date that the determination was made to admit to acute inpatient care and the order was written. Do not abstract the date that the patient was admitted to Observation.
Example:
Medical record documentation reflects that the patient was admitted to observation on 04-05-20xx. On 04-06-20xx the physician writes an order to admit to acute inpatient effective 04-05-20xx. The Admission Date would be abstracted as 04-06-20xx; the date the determination was made to admit to acute inpatient care and the order was written.
The admission date should not be abstracted from the earliest admission order without regards to substantiating documentation. If documentation suggests that the earliest admission order does not reflect the date the patient was admitted to inpatient care, this date should not be used.
Example:
Preoperative Orders are dated as 04-06-20xx with an order to admit to Inpatient. Postoperative Orders, dated 05-01-20xx, state to admit to acute inpatient. All other documentation supports that the patient presented to the hospital for surgery on 05-01-20xx. The admission date would be abstracted as 05-01-20xx.
If there are multiple inpatient orders, use the order that most accurately reflects the date that the patient was admitted.
For newborns that are born within this hospital, the admission date would be the date the baby was born.
For inpatient strokes, enter the actual hospital admit date and not the date of stroke symptom discovery. Note this is not from the definition from Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures. 
Suggested Data Sources:

Note: The physician order is the priority data source for this data element. If there is not a physician order in the medical record, use the other only allowable sources to determine the Admission Date.

OPTIONAL: Not Admitted?

Was patient evaluated in the ED for acute Stroke or TIA and never admitted as an inpatient to your hospital?

Yes, not admitted: Patient was evaluated in the Emergency Department (ED), found to have a diagnosis of Ischemic Stroke, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Intracerebral Hemorrhage, or Transient Ischemic Attack, and was never admitted to your hospital as an inpatient. Include here patients that are transferred from the ED to another acute care hospital, those that are discharged directly from the ED to home or other location, those that leave against medical advice (AMA) from the ED, those that die in the ED, and those that are discharged from observation status without ever being admitted as an inpatient.
No, patient admitted as inpatient: Patient was admitted to your hospital.
Note: Patients with a response option of “Yes, not admitted” will only be included in the following Achievement and Quality measures: t-PA measures, door to needle measures, dysphagia screen, CT measures, and NIHSS reported.

Notes for Abstraction:

Transferred from your ED to another acute care hospital: Patient was evaluated in the ED and subsequently transferred to another acute care hospital.
This field will enable 2 fields for the referring hospital to indicate where the patient is being transferred and the reason for transfering the patient from your hospital
Additionally, if Reason Not Admitted = "Transferred from your ED to another acute care hospital" is selected, the field will auto-populate the field, For patients discharged on or after 04/01/2011: What is the patient's discharge disposition on the day of discharge? = 4 Acute Care Facilities.
Discharged directly from ED to home or other location that is not an acute care hospital: Patient was evaluated in the ED and discharged directly from the ED to home or other location not defined elsewhere in this list. Excludes patients who were transferred to another acute care hospital, patients that leave from the ED against medical advice (AMA), and patients discharged from the ED who qualify as observation status.
Left from ED AMA: Patient was evaluated in the ED and left directly from the ED against medical advice (AMA).
Died in ED: Patient died after being evaluated in the ED.
Discharged from observation status without an inpatient admission: Patient was evaluated in the ED and discharged from observation status without a qualifying inpatient admission.
Only select "Discharge from observation status without an inpatient admission"� if the patient was discharged from the hospital as an observation stay (and was never admitted as an inpatient stay), regardless of the physical location or billing status of the patient during their treatment. Typically, these patients are found in the ED/observation treatment unit, holding units, or in observation status beds in the inpatient area.
Observation status should be determined based upon the patient�€™s hospital stay and the intent of the medical team, and not based upon billing status or physical location of the patient. For example, if the medical team documents that the patient should be admitted as an inpatient, but the claim is later denied as inpatient stay (and is instead reimbursed at observation level) you would still enter this patient as an inpatient as the intent of the medical team was for this patient to be admitted as an inpatient stay. In this case, select "No, admitted to inpatient" for the previous "Not Admitted?" data element.
Other: Patient was not admitted as an inpatient but discharge disposition from the ED is not defined elsewhere in this list.
Note: For patients with an ED discharge disposition of transferred from your ED to another acute care hospital, discharged directly from ED to home or other location that is not an acute care hospital, left from ED AMA, died in ED, or other, all post-admission fields in the following sections will be disabled:

Time must be recorded in military time format. Except for Midnight and Noon
If the time is in the a.m., conversion is not required
If the time is in the p.m., add 12 to the clock time hour
Examples:
Midnight - 00:00

Noon = 12:00

5:31 am = 05:31

5:31 pm = 17:31

11:59 am = 11:59

11:59 pm = 23:59

Note: 00:00 = midnight. If the time is documented as 00:00 11-24-20xx, review supporting documentation to determine if the First Radiographic Image Date should remain 11-24-20xx or if it should be converted to 11-25-20xx.

When converting Midnight or 24:00 to 00:00, do not forget to change the First Radiographic Image Date.

Example:

Midnight or 24:00 on 11-24-20xx = 00:00 on 11-25-20xx

Notes for Abstraction:

This should be the same as the discharge date/time field on the Admin tab (same tab)

Discharge Date and Time (Date and Time of discharge from hospital)

Required field

Definition: Record the month, day, andyear the patient was discharged from acute care, left against medical advice, or expired during this stay.
Date:MM/DD/YYYY
Time: HH:MM
24-hour clock (military time)
Notes for Abstraction:

Because this data element is critical in determining the population for all measures, the abstractor should NOT assume that the claim information for the discharge date is correct.
If the abstractor determines through chart review that the claim date is incorrect, she/he should correct and override the downloaded value. If the abstractor is unable to determine the correct discharge date through chart review, she/he should default to the claim discharge date.
The discharge date is the day that the patient is discharged from your institution's acute care unit OR the date of the patient's expiration OR the date of the patient's discharge OR date patient left against medical advice (AMA) OR date of transfer to, a rehabilitating, skilled nursing, or hospice unit in your institution OR transfer to an acute in-patient unit outside of your own institution, even if that hospital is affiliated with your own OR expired.
If the patient is never admitted to your facility (i.e. you answered the data element of “Not Admitted” as “Yes, Not Admitted” enter the date of discharge from the ED or observation unit.”

4 Acute Care Facility
5 Other Health Care Facility
6 Expired
7 Left Against Medical Advice/AMA
8 Not Documented or Unable to Determine (UTD)

Notes for Abstraction:

Only use documentation written on the day prior to discharge through 30 days after discharge when abstracting this data element.
Example: Documentation in the Discharge Planning notes on 04-01-20xx state that the patient will be discharged back home. On 04-06-20xx the physician orders and nursing discharge notes on the day of discharge reflect that the patient was being transferred to skilled care. The documentation from 04-06-20xx would be used to select value "5" (Other Health Care Facility).
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at “face value”). Inferences should not be made based on internal knowledge.
If there is documentation that further clarifies the level of care that documentation should be used to determine the correct value to abstract. If documentation is contradictory, use the latest documentation. 
Examples:
Discharge summary dictated 2 days after discharge states patient went “home”. Physician note on day of discharge further clarifies that the patient will be going "home with hospice”. Select value “2” (“Hospice - Home”).
Discharge planner note from day before discharge states “XYZ Nursing Home”. Discharge order from day of discharge states “Discharge home”. Contradictory documentation, use latest. Select value “1” (“Home”).
Physician order on discharge states “Discharge to ALF”. Discharge instruction sheet completed after the physician order states patient discharged to “SNF”. Contradictory documentation, use latest. Select value “5” (“Other Health Care Facility”).
If documentation is contradictory, and you are unable to determine the latest documentation, select the disposition ranked highest (top to bottom) in the following list. See Inclusion lists for examples.
Acute Care Facility
Hospice – Health Care Facility
Hospice – Home
Other Health Care Facility
Home
Hospice (values “2” and “3”) includes discharges with hospice referrals and evaluations.
If the medical record states only that the patient is being discharged to another hospital and does not reflect the level of care that the patient will be receiving, select value “4” (“Acute Care Facility”).
If the medical record identifies the facility the patient is being discharged to by name only (e.g., “Park Meadows”), and does not reflect the type of facility or level of care, select value “5” (“Other Health Care Facility”).
If the medical record states only that the patient is being “discharged” and does not address the place or setting to which the patient was discharged, select value “1” (“Home”).
When determining whether to select value “7” (“Left Against Medical Advice/AMA”):
Explicit “left against medical advice” documentation is not required. E.g., “Patient is refusing to stay for continued care” – Select value “7”.
Documentation suggesting that the patient left before discharge instructions could be given does not count.
A signed AMA form is not required, for the purposes of this data element.
Do not consider AMA documentation and other disposition documentation as “contradictory”. If any source states the patient left against medical advice, select value “7”, regardless of whether the AMA documentation was written last. E.g., AMA form signed and discharge instruction sheet states “Discharged home with belongings” – Select “7”.

Notes for Abstraction:

If the principal procedure date is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select "UTD."
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at "face value"). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format or is outside of the parameters of care [after Discharge Date ]) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select "UTD."
Examples:
Documentation indicates the ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure Date was 02- 42- 20XX . No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure Date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for "Day," it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select "UTD."
Patient expires on 02-12-20XX and documentation indicates the ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure Date was 03-12- 20XX . Other documentation in the medical record supports the date of death as being accurate. Since the ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure Date is after the Discharge Date (death), it is outside of the parameter of care and the abstractor should select "UTD."
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the CMS Clinical Warehouse and the Joint Commission's Data Warehouse. Use of "UTD" for ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.

Notes for Abstraction:

For times that include seconds, remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00.
The ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure Time is the time associated with the start of the principle procedure performed during the hospitalization. If a patient enters the operating room or interventional suite, but the principal procedure is canceled before it is initiated and the principal procedure performed at a later time, the ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure Time is the start time when the procedure was actually performed.
If the start time when the principal procedure was performed is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select "UTD".
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at "face value"). When the principal procedure start time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select "UTD". 
Example:
Documentation indicates the start time of the ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure was 3300. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid time. Since the start time of the ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for "Hour," it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select "UTD". 
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid time as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commission's Data Warehouse. Use of "UTD" for ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure Time allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
If the principal procedure start time is obviously incorrect (in error) but it is a valid time and the correct time can be supported with other documentation in the medical record, the correct time may be entered. If supporting documentation of the correct time cannot be found, the medical record must be taken at face value. 
Examples:
The principal procedure start time is documented as 10:00 but other documentation in the medical record supports the correct time as 22:00. Enter the correct time of 22:00 as the ICD-9-CM Principal Procedure Time.
The principal procedure end time of 11:58 is documented but the principal procedure start time is documented as 11:57. If no other documentation can be found to support another principal procedure start time, then it must be abstracted as 11:57 because the time is not considered invalid or outside the parameter of care.

Examples:

Documentation indicates the ICD-9-CM Other Procedure Dates was 02- 42- 20 XX . No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the ICD-9-CM Other Procedure Dates is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for "Day," it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select "UTD."

Patient expires on 02-12-20 XX and documentation indicates the ICD-9-CM Other Procedure Dates was 03-12-20 XX . Other documentation in the medical record supports the date of death as being accurate. Since the ICD-9-CM Other Procedure Dates is after the Discharge Date (death), it is outside of the parameters of care and the abstractor should select "UTD."

Element definition from The Joint Commission Comprehensive Stroke Performance Measurement Implementation Guide

Data Element Name: ICD-9-CM Other Procedure Times

Collected For: CSTK-01, CSTK-03

Definition: The time (military time) when the associated procedure(s) was (were) performed.

Suggested Data Collection Question: What were the time(s) the other procedure(s) were performed?

Format

Type: Time
Occurs: 24

Allowable Values:

HH = Hour (00-23)
MM = Minutes (00-59)
UTD = Unable to Determine

Notes for Abstraction:

For times that include seconds, remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00.
The ICD-9-CM Other Procedure Times are the time(s) associated with the start of procedures performed after the principal procedure. If a patient enters the operating room or interventional suite, but the procedure is canceled before it is initiated and the procedure performed at a later time, the ICD-9-CM Other Procedure Times are the start time(s) when the procedure(s) were actually performed.
If the procedure start time is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select "UTD".
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at "face value"). When the procedure start time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select "UTD". 
Example:
Documentation indicates the procedure start time was 3300. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid time. Since the procedure start time is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for "Hour," it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select "UTD". 
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid time as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commission's Data Warehouse. Use of "UTD" for ICD-9-CM Other Procedure Times allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
If the procedure start time is obviously incorrect (in error) but it is a valid time and the correct time can be supported with other documentation in the medical record, the correct time may be entered. If supporting documentation of the correct time cannot be found, the medical record must be taken at face value. 
Examples:
The procedure start time is documented as 10:00 but other documentation in the medical record supports the correct time as 22:00. Enter the correct time of 22:00 as the ICD-9-CM Other Procedure Time(s).
The procedure end time of 11:58 is documented but the procedure start time is documented as 11:57. If no other documentation can be found to support another procedure start time, then it must be abstracted as 11:57 because the time is not considered invalid or outside the parameter of care.

Notes for Abstraction:


To select "Yes" to this data element, BOTH of the following must be true:
There must be a signed consent form for clinical trial. For the purposes of abstraction, a clinical trial is defined as an experimental study in which research subjects are recruited and assigned a treatment/intervention and their outcomes are measured based on the intervention received.  Treatments/interventions most often include use of drugs, surgical procedures, and devices.  Often a control group is used to compare with the treatment/intervention. Allocation of different interventions to participants is usually randomized.
There must be documentation on the signed consent form that during this hospital stay the patient was enrolled in a clinical trial in which patients with the same condition as the measure set were being studied (i.e. STK, VTE) . Patients may either be newly enrolled in a clinical trial during the hospital stay or enrolled in a clinical trial prior to arrival and continued active participation in that clinical trial during this hospital stay.
In the following situations, select "No":

There is a signed patient consent form for an observational study only. Observational studies are non-experimental and involve no intervention (e.g., registries).  Individuals are observed (perhaps with lab draws, interviews, etc.), data is collected, and outcomes are tracked by investigators. Although observational studies may include the assessment of the effects of an intervention, the study participants are not allocated into intervention or control groups.
It is not clear whether the study described in the signed patient consent form is experimental or observational.
It is not clear which study population the clinical trial is enrolling . Assumptions should not be made if it is not specified.

REQUIRED for TJC & COMPREHENSIVE: Was this patient admitted for the sole purpose of performance of elective carotid intervention?

Element definition from Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures

Documentation demonstrates that the current admission is solely for the performance of an elective carotid intervention (e.g., elective carotid endarterectomy, angioplasty, carotid stenting).

Yes (There is documentation that this admission was solely for the performance of elective carotid intervention.)
No (There is no documentation that this admission was solely for the performance of elective carotid intervention, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.)
Notes for Abstraction

When documentation clearly indicates that the carotid intervention is elective (e.g.,
admitting orders to obtain informed consent for a carotid procedure; pre-operative
testing completed prior to admission; surgical orders for carotid endarterectomy dated
prior to arrival; physician office visit documentation prior to arrival stating, “CEA with
Dr. X planned in the near future”), select “Yes.”
Patients who are sent to the hospital by their physician and admitted for performance
of a carotid intervention, select “Yes.”
Patients admitted to the hospital for purposes of performance of a carotid intervention
and the intervention cancelled/postponed during the hospital stay, select “Yes.”
Patients who request admission to the hospital for performance of a carotid
intervention, select “Yes.”
Patients transferred to the hospital for purposes of surgical evaluation for performance
of a carotid intervention, select “Yes.”
When the patient is directly admitted to the hospital post-procedure following an
elective carotid intervention performed as an outpatient, select “Yes.”
Example:
Patient scheduled for elective carotid endarterectomy right side on 05/17/20xx at
08:30. Patient checks into outpatient surgery at 06:13 and proceeds to the O.R., then
to PACU. Patient status is changed to inpatient at 11:35 on 05/17/20xx. Patient
discharged home on 05/18/20xx.
EXCEPTION:
Patients with documentation of an elective carotid intervention performed and
discharged from the outpatient setting prior to hospital admission for stroke.
Example:
Pt. scheduled for outpatient placement of an elective right carotid stent on 05/17/20xx.
Patient discharged home on 05/17/20xx following the procedure. Patient arrives in the
ED two days later with complaints of syncope and left-sided numbness, and is
admitted to the hospital on 05/19/20xx.
Patients who are symptomatic and come to the ED for treatment of stroke signs and
symptoms and then admitted to the hospital are not considered elective admissions,
even if a carotid intervention was performed after admission, select “No.”
When documentation of the procedure is not linked with “elective,” select “No.”

Notes for Abstraction

If the patient was a resident of a nursing home, but was out with family for the day and suffered a stroke and the family/EMS brought the patient to your hospital, choose "Not in a healthcare setting".
If the patient was at home, at work, or even a visitor in your hospital and had stroke symptoms, then choose "Not in a healthcare setting".
If the patient was transferred to your hospital from another hospital’s ED or inpatient unit but was outside of a healthcare facility when the stroke occurred, choose "Not in a healthcare setting".
If the patient was a resident of a nursing home and the stroke occurred at the NH, choose "Chronic healthcare facility".
A chronic care facility would include nursing home, long-term care facility, inpatient rehab facility, psychiatric hospital, and transitional care unit. This is in alignment with the designation of this type of facility as Value 5-Other Healthcare Facility for the Discharge Disposition data element.
If the patient was a resident of an assisted living facility, and the stroke occurred at the assisted living facility, choose "Not in a healthcare setting." This is in alignment with the designation of an assisted living facility as Value 1- Home for the Discharge Disposition data element.
If the patient is at a clinic or physician office visit, or at your hospital but receiving outpatient procedure or service that did not require the patient to be admitted as an inpatient, select "Outpatient healthcare setting".
If the patient was already admitted as an inpatient in your hospital when stroke symptoms were first discovered choose "Stroke occurred after hospital arrival (in ED/Obs/inpatient)".
If the patient was already within your hospital ED, radiology suite, or observation unit and experienced a new onset of stroke symptoms, then choose "Stroke occurred after hospital arrival (in ED/Obs/inpatient)".
Only those hospitals that are interested in collecting information regarding inpatient stroke care should enter these patients. Patients who have transient symptoms that are present on arrival to the ED but resolve, and then later return during the hospitalization and meet criteria for ischemic stroke should all be entered as inpatient strokes.

Y (Yes) There is documentation the patient was an ED patient. 

N (No) There is no documentation the patient was an ED patient, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation. 
Notes for Abstraction:
For the purposes of this data element an ED patient is defined as any patient receiving care or services in the Emergency Department.
Patients seen in an Urgent Care, ER Fast Track, etc. are not considered an ED patient unless they received services in the emergency department at the facility (e.g., patient treated at an urgent care and transferred to the main campus ED is considered an ED patient, but a patient seen at the urgent care and transferred to the hospital as a direct admit would not be considered an ED patient).
Patients presenting to the ED who do not receive care or services in the ED abstract as a "No" (e.g., patient is sent to hospital from physician office and presents to ED triage and is instructed to proceed straight to floor).
Patients presenting to the ED for outpatient services such as lab work etc. will abstract as a "Yes."
ED: (Abstraction Guidelines for ED Measures Only)

If a patient is transferred in from any emergency department (ED) or observation unit OUTSIDE of your hospital, select "No." This applies even if the emergency department or observation unit is part of your hospital's system (e.g., your hospital's free-standing or satellite emergency department), has a shared medical record or provider number, or is in close proximity. Select "No", even if the transferred patient is seen in this facility’s ED.
If the patient is transferred to your hospital from an outside hospital where he was an inpatient or outpatient, select "No." This applies even if the two hospitals are close in proximity, part of the same hospital system, have the same provider number, and/or there is one medical record. Select "No", even if the transferred patient is seen in this facility’s ED.

Notes for Abstraction:
Check the appropriate field. The steps below are used to determine:
Admission Type
Stroke Consult
Stroke Unit
First indicate if the patient was admitted by a neurologiest or other service.
Then indicate if the patient had a stroke consult.
Finally indicate if the patient was cared for in a stroke unit.


Examples: 
Patient 030a arrived in the ED and was seen by the neurology resident (or neurologist) and admitted to the neurology service. Patient was admitted to the stroke unit. Select "Neurology Admission" and "In Stroke Unit". 

Patient 030b admitted by internist to the general medical floor with neurology consult requested. Neurology consult occurred on medical ward and patient was then transferred to stroke unit. Select "Other Service Admission", "Stroke Consult", and "Not in Stroke Unit. 

Patient 030c admitted by internist to stroke unit by internist. There is no neurologist at this hospital, which dedicates two telemetry beds specifically for stroke patients. Select "Other Service Admission", "No Stroke Consult", and "In Stroke Unit".

Summary of Changes

REQUIRED: Advanced notification by EMS?(Traditional Responder or Mobile Stroke Unit)

Definition: EMS personnel should provide prehospital notification to the receiving hospital that a suspected stroke patient is en route so that the appropriate hospital resources may be mobilized before patient arrival. For this element, record if EMS personnel notified the receiving hospital prior to the arrival of possible stroke patient. 

Allowable Values:
Yes
No/ND
N/A

Notes for Abstraction:
Yes: EMS notified the receiving hospital prior to arrival
To select Yesthere must be explicit documentation that advanced notification by EMS included that the patient was a suspected storke.
The following language is sufficient to identify patients with suspected stroke; any use of the word "stroke" or any documentation of signs & symptoms consistent with stroke is acceptable:
N/A: the patient did not arrive via EMS
Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm or leg - especially on one side of the body.
Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.
Sudden severe headache with no known cause.
No/ND: EMS either did not pre-notify the receiving hospital or there is no documentation regarding EMS pre-notification.
N/A: the patient did not arrive via EMS


Example: Patient 010a was picked up by the EMTs at 0810. On their departure to the hospital at 0820, they call the ED to inform them they are bringing in a potential stroke patient. They arrive at the ED at 0830. The hospital was therefore pre-notified that a potential stroke patient was arriving.

Notes for Abstraction:

Atrial Fib/Flutter: The patient has ANY prior history of atrial fibrillation OR atrial flutter (i.e., remote, paroxysmal or persistent.) Do not record a history of Atrial Fib/Flutter if the episode was transient AND entirely reversible due to thyrotoxicosis or within 8 weeks of CABG (these are the only two circumstances in which you would not record a history of Atrial fib/flutter). Any patient with a history of Atrial Fib/Flutter who has undergone a procedure for atrial fib/flutter such as pacemaker placement or ablation or who is under medical therapy for rhythm control is still considered as having a history of Atrial Fib/Flutter and you should select afib/flutter under medical history. Example: Documented history of ablation procedure, select Atrial Fib/Flutter here.
CAD/prior MI: Select CAD/Prior MI if there is a history of coronary artery disease, or a physician diagnosed MI or EKG evidence of an old MI prior to this event.
Carotid Stenosis: Stenosis may be documented either (1) in words in the record as "moderate" or greater than or equal to 50%, (2) previous duplex ultrasound or MR/CT/conventional angiography methods recorded as "moderate" or greater than or equal to 50%, (3) history of carotid endarterectomy or stenting.
Depression: Patient has a history of treated depression or is currently taking antidepressant medication
Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a history of physician diagnosed diabetes (Types I or II) regardless of duration of disease or use of treatment including the use of diet, need for antidiabetic agents, oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin, or a fasting blood sugar greater than 7 mmol/l or 126 mg/dl. Do not include diabetes based on a patient's statements about elevated glucose or based on a single value of elevated blood sugar in the medical record. In order to select this element, there must be a confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
Drugs/Alcohol Abuse: History of drug and/or alcohol abuse.
Dyslipidemia: Document history of Dyslipidemia, if high cholesterol, hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia is present based on physician diagnosis, treatment with a lipid lowering agent, total cholesterol greater than 200, LDL greater than 130, HDL less than 40, or elevated triglycerides greater than 200. Patients on lipid lowering therapy are included in this category even if their LDL levels are in range. See Adult Treatment Protocol (ATP) III Clinical Guidelines for further clarification and methods of calculating goal based on Framingham risk data (www.nhlbi.nih.gov).
Family History of Stroke: Includes stroke diagnosis in any first degree relative (father, mother, siblings).
Heart Failure: Documented history of Heart Failure, includes CHF
HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy): Therapy consisting of estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin designed to replace the loss of these hormones in menopause or from oophorectomy. May be also documented as: hormone therapy (HT), estrogen therapy (ET), estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), menopause hormone therapy (MHT).
Hypertension: Hypertension (HTN) is present if the patient has a history of high blood pressure whether or not the patient is on prescribed medications, current use of antihypertensive pharmacological therapy or history of HTN diagnosed and treated with medication, diet, and/or exercise. Do not base this decision solely on blood pressure recordings taken in the ED or in the first few days of admission after stroke, since many normotensive patients will have elevated BP after stroke.
Migraine: A documented history of migraine headache or of any recurrent or incapacitating headache.
Obesity/Overweight: History of obesity/overweight or a BMI of 25 or higher.
Previous Stroke: Refers to a history of stroke. If receiving a patient in transfer (i.e. your facility receives drip and ship patients) and there is no history of stroke prior to the acute event for which the patient is being hospitalized, do not select previous stroke.
Previous TIA: Refers to a history of transient ischemic attack. If receiving a patient in transfer and there is no history of TIA prior to the acute event for which the patient is being hospitalized, do not select previous TIA.
Pregnancy: Includes women who are currently pregnant, or within six weeks post-partum
PVD: Peripheral Vascular Disease, refers to a history of peripheral vascular disease of the arteries of the extremities, especially conditions that interfere with adequate blood flow to the extremities and occurring prior to this acute event. Example: peripheral arterial occlusion, abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Renal insufficiency – chronic (SCr>2.0): Select if there is a history of physician diagnosed renal insufficiency or chronic failure or if the serum creatinine is greater than 2.0mg/dl.
Sickle Cell: Documented history of Sickle Cell. Include Sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait, or sickle cell anemia
Sleep Apnea: Patient has a history of sleep apnea, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or central sleep apnea (CSA).
Smoker: Smoking history - patient has smoked at least one cigarette within the past year.
When not to select Smoker:

* In some cases smoking history documentation in one medical record source may further clarify the patient's smoking history documented in another medical record source.
Examples:

Progress note states “history of smoking” and the nursing admission assessment notes “quit 2 years ago” – Do not select Smoker.
Discharge summary states smoker without specifying the type of tobacco and the ED record specifies the type of tobacco as cigar – Do not select Smoker.
* In cases where at least one source has specific documentation that the patient has not smoked anytime during the year prior to hospital arrival - Do not select Smoker.
Examples:

“Current smoker” per H&P, but consultation note states patient “quit 2 years ago” – Do not select Smoker.
“ + tobacco use” per ED note, “Smoker – Yes” per nursing admission note, but H&P states, “Quit smoking in 2002” – Do not select Smoker.
Progress note states “Still smokes occasionally” but nursing admission assessment has “No” circled next to “Tobacco use within past year” – Do not select Smoker.
* Do not include documentation of smoking history referenced as a “risk factor” (e.g., “risk factor: tobacco,” “risk factor: smoking,” “risk factor: smoker”), where current smoking status is indeterminable.

* If there is a history of smoking and documentation indicates the patient quit, but the timeframe in which the patient quit is not clear, Do not select Smoker.
Examples:

Nursing admission assessment documents patient as “ex- smoker” or “former smoker,” or simply notes pt. “quit smoking” - Do not select Smoker.
“History of tobacco abuse” per H&P, and consultation note states “nonsmoker” - Do not select Smoker (not a case of conflicting information)
* Further Examples for not selecting Smoker:

Chewing tobacco use only
Cigar smoking only
Cigarette smoking within one year prior to arrival or any of the other inclusion terms described using one of the following qualifiers: cannot exclude, cannot rule out, may have, may have had, may indicate, possible, suggestive of, suspect or suspicious
Illegal drug use only (e.g., marijuana)
Oral tobacco use only
Pipe smoking only
Remote smoker (smoked in the past, but greater than one year ago)
* E-cigarettes and vapors are not considered smoking. Please select smoker = No if these are the only products being used by the patient.

When to select Smoker:

* In cases where conflicting information about the patient's smoking history is documented and there is no specific documentation that the patient has not smoked during the year prior to hospital arrival, select Smoker.
Examples:

"Current smoker” per H&P, but ED note states “Non-smoker” – select Smoker.
“Cigarette Smoking: Yes, 1-2 cigarettes a day” on nursing admission
“Cigarette Smoking: Yes, 1-2 cigarettes a day” on nursing admission note, but “Smoking – Quit” on H&P – select Smoker.
“Recent smoker” in H&P, but progress note states “Smokes – No” – select Smoker.
* If there is documentation of current smoking or tobacco use, or a history of smoking or tobacco use, and the type of product is not specified, assume this refers to cigarette smoking.

* If there is a history of smoking and documentation that the patient quit “several months ago,” infer the patient smoked within one year prior to arrival, and select Smoker.

* Further Examples for selecting Smoker:

+ smoker, type of product not identified
+ tobacco use, type of product not identified
History of cigarette use without mention of a time frame, if no indication that patient quit
History of smoking (type of product not identified), without mention of a time frame, if no indication that patient quit

ND
For patients who are in a healthcare environment prior to admission:

Able to ambulate independently (no help from another person) w/ or w/o device: Patient ambulating without assistance (no help from another person) with or without a device. This means patient is able to ambulate without help from another person. The use of a device, such as a cane, still meets this definition. Patient ambulating to and from the bathroom unassisted. Even though actual ambulation is not documented in the medical record, privileges to walk to and from the bathroom and evidence of the patient getting out of bed unassisted are considered to meet the definition of ambulation.
With assistance (from person): Patient ambulating with assistance of another person.
Unable to ambulate : Patient is on bedrest. Patient is only getting out of bed to the bedside commode (or up in chair) and is primarily in the bed (or immobile).
ND: If it is unable to determine from documentation.
For patients not in a healthcare setting prior to admission:

Able to ambulate independently (no help from another person) w/ or w/o device: Patient ambulating without assistance (no help from another person) with or without a device. This means patient is able to ambulate without help from another person. The use of a device, such as a cane, still meets this definition. Patient ambulating around the house unassisted, even if they need assistance to walk outside.
With assistance (from person): Patient ambulating with assistance of another person.
Unable to ambulate: Patient is bedridden or currently on bedrest recovering from an injury or illness. Patient is only getting out of bed to the bedside commode (or up in chair) and is primarily in the bed (or immobile)

REQUIRED: Initial NIH Stroke scale

Was NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) performed as part of initial evaluation?

Yes: An NIH Stroke Scale was performed as part of the initial evaluation or neurology consultation.
No/ND: An NIH Stroke Scale was not performed or was performed but the total score is not available.
Notes for Abstraction:

You should be looking for the first NIHSS calculated or documented based on the first arrival notes or in the first neurology consultation note, whichever comes first. Patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous tPA or with an acute endovascular procedure at your facility should be included as a “Yes” response only if the NIHSS is performed before the start of these treatments. If the first NIH Stroke Scale score was calculated or documented only after treatment with intravenous tPA or acute endovascular procedure at your facility, 48 hours after arrival in those patients that do not receive thrombolytic treatment, or not performed at all, then select "No/ND."
If comprehensive neurological findings are outlined in first arrival notes or in the first neurology consultation note that enables you to abstract the complete NIHSS, answer "Yes" to this data element and enter the findings into the sub questions under the “Total Score”.
If another stroke scale was performed instead, including the Modified NIH Stroke Scale, answer “No/ND”.
For patients that receive thrombolytic therapy at an outside hospital prior to transfer to your facility, answer this data element based off of the first NIHSS performed at your own hospital. For patients received in transfer that undergo additional treatment such as IA catheter based reperfusion or mechanical recanalization at your facility, answer “Yes” only in those patients in whom an NIHSS is performed prior to this treatment. For patients received in transfer that do not undergo additional treatment, answer “Yes” only if the first NIHSS was performed at your facility within 48 hours of arrival.
The initial NIH Stroke Scale may be documented by a member of the "stroke team" (including the physician/APN/PA or nurse (RN)). It is highly recommended that the NIHSS be performed by a certified examiner.
For inpatient stroke, you should be looking for the first NIHSS calculated or documented in the first neurology consultation note, or medical encounter note, after discovery of stroke symptoms in the hospital. Patients with an inpatient acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous tPA, or with an acute endovascular procedure, should be included as a “Yes” response only if the NIHSS is performed before the start of these treatments. If the patient arrives to the hospital with transient symptoms that resolve, and an NIHSS was performed at that time, but later in the hospital stay the patient has new onset stroke symptoms and meets criteria to be entered as an inpatient stroke, a new NIHSS should be performed and the results of the NIHSS performed after discovery of new onset of stroke symptoms should be used. If a new NIHSS is not performed after new symptom discovery, select "No/ND". Do not use the results of the NIHSS done prior to new symptom discovery.
Example: Patient 072 presents to the ED with complaints of dizziness, fatigue, and slurred speech which resolve prior to admission. NIHSS was documented as 1. The following day, the patient has new onset slurred speech and right leg weakness. NIHSS is performed immediately after stroke symptom discovery and is documented as a 6. Enter this patient as an inpatient stroke and select "Yes" for "Initial NIH Stroke scale" and enter 6 for "Total Score".

Notes for Abstraction:

Use the date that the NIHSS score was first performed. If a discrepancy exists in date documentation from different sources, choose the earliest date. If there are two or more initial NIHSS score dates (either different NIHSS assessments or corresponding with the sameassessment), enter the earliest date.
If the initial NIHSS score date is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD.
Example:
Documentation indicates the initial NIHSS date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the initial NIHSS date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Day, it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select UTD. 
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for Initial NIHSS Score Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
Use the time for which the NIHSS score was first performed. If a discrepancy exists in time documentation from different sources, choose the earliest time. If there are two or more different initial NIHSS score times (either different NIHSS assessments or corresponding with the sameassessment), enter the earliest time.
If the time of the first NIHSS score is a time prior to hospital arrival because the score was obtained by teleneurology or MD/APN/PA directly receiving the patient via life flight, use the Arrival Time for the score time.
For times that include seconds, remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00
Initial NIHSS Score Time refers to the time that the first NIHSS score was performed. If the time performed is mentioned in the body of a note, select the time performed rather than the time stamp on the note. If the only time documented with the score is the time stamp on the note, then select the time stamped. Examples:
Documentation indicates that the initial NIHSS score was done at 0920. Time stamp on the note is 1159. The abstractor should select 0920 for Initial NIHSS Score Time.
Documentation indicates that the NIHSS score done on arrival was 12. Patient arrived at your hospital 2100. Time stamp on the note is 2136. The abstractor should select 2100 for Initial NIHSS Score Time.
NIHSS score 12 [no time] documented. Time stamp on the note is 1513. The abstractor should select 1513 for Initial NIHSS Score Time.
Do not use physician orders as they do not demonstrate the NIHSS score was done (in the ED this may be used if signed/initialed by a nurse).
Times for scores done prior to arrival by a teleneurologist are acceptable if signed/initialed by a nurse.
If the time of the first NIHSS score is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD.
Example:
Documentation indicates the initial NIHSS score time was 3300. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid time. Since the initial NIHSS score time is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Hour, it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select UTD. 
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid time as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for Initial NIHSS Score Time allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.

Notes for Abstraction:

If more than one NIHSS is performed at the transferring facility, enter the first score recorded. 
If NIHSS from transferring facility is not available, leave blank.
The NIHSS performed at the transferring hospital is not a substitute for performing the NIHSS at your hospital. It is expected that the NIHSS be performed by an appropriate clinician at your hospital and you must complete the data elements of “Initial NIH Stroke Scale” and “Total Score” based upon care provided at your hospital. The “NIHSS Score Obtained from Transferring Facility” does not qualify in the measure “NIHSS Reported” at your hospital.
Summary of Changes

REQUIRED: Initial Exam Findings

This data element is only required if Initial NIH Stroke Scale = No (meaning that an initial NIHSS was not performed or was performed but the total score is not available). If Initial NIH Stroke Scale = Yes then this data element (Initial Exam Findings) is Optional (and is not necessary to save the record as complete.)

Identify from the initial (first) neurological exam in the record which of the following findings were present at the time of hospital arrival or when the first complete exam was performed on the patient. Select all that apply:

Weakness/Paresis: Includes any mention of weakness or paresis of an arm, leg, side of the face, or any part of the body. This includes documentation of terms such as hemiparesis, hemiplegia, quadriparesis, quadriplegia, paraparesis, or paraplegia, as well as flaccidity or drift of the limbs, facial droop, or evidence of impaired strength. This element does NOT include mention of clumsiness, ataxia, incoordination, gait trouble, fatigue or generalized weakness.
Altered Level of Consciousness: Includes any mention of decreased alertness, sleepiness, drowsiness, stupor, coma, difficulty to arouse, need for painful stimulation to gain the patients attention, Documentation of a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) that includes No eye opening. Eye opening to pain or Eye opening to verbal command would qualify.
Aphasia/Language Disturbance: Includes loss of the ability to communicate or disturbances of language and communication. This can be documented as slurring of speech, dysarthria, difficulty with producing speech (including the terms non-fluent, Broca’s, Wernike’s, paraphasia, dysphasia, mutism), following commands, naming objects, repeating phrases, speaking fluently, or answering questions appropriately. Documentation of a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) that includes No verbal response, Incomprehensible sounds or Inappropriate words would qualify.
Other neurological signs/symptoms: Other neurological findings were documented in the record which do not fit the above specified categories.
No neurological signs/symptoms: No neurological signs or symptoms were present on arrival or when the first neurological exam was performed. If you select this option, you should not check any other box.
ND: There is no documentation of neurological signs and symptoms in the record because there was no neurological exam performed at any at any point in the hospital stay. If you select this option, you should not check any other box.
Notes for Abstraction:

The initial exam findings should be determined based upon the first neurological exam performed on the patient whether performed on arrival, in the ED or later in the hospital stay and should be documented by a physician (including an ED physician or neurologist).
If the patient’s neurological exam is limited due to loss of consciousness or other conditions select only those findings that have been assessed. Do not infer the presence of findings. Record only those findings found in the hospital record.
Only select “ND” if there was no neurological exam performed during the hospital stay. Do NOT select "ND" based solely on whether an exam is documented in the ED notes. If an initial neurological exam was not performed in the ED, use the first documented exam during the hospital stay and record the findings of that exam. There is no time limit on when the exam should have been performed. Use the first exam, even if it occurs later in the hospital stay after ED admission.
If the NIHSS or Glasgow Coma Scale is performed as a component of the initial (first) neurological exam, it is acceptable to use the individual components of the NIHSS or Glasgow Coma Scale, if documented in the medical record to assist in identifying the presence of the following signs or symptoms.
Use only information obtained once the patient has arrived at the hospital (i.e. if the only documented GCS is from EMS records prior to patient arrival to your ED, you should not use this documentation).
For inpatient stroke, use the first neurological exam performed after the date/time of discovery of stroke symptoms in the hospital. If the patient arrives to the hospital with transient symptoms that resolve and a neurological exam was performed but later in the hospital stay the patient has new onset stroke symptoms and meets criteria to be entered as an inpatient stroke, a new neurological exam should be performed and the results from the new exam should be used to select initial exam findings.
Note: The presence of weakness, altered level of consciousness or aphasia/language disturbance has been shown to be correlated with worse patient outcomes.

Example: Patient 071 presents with visual loss, right body tingling, and ataxia documented on the admission notes. Weakness, altered level of consciousness, and aphasia are not present. Select "Other neurological signs/symptoms".

Patient 071B presents to the ED with complaints of dizziness, fatigue, and slurred speech. Symptoms resolve while in the ED. Patient is admitted and the following day the patient has new onset of lurred speech and right leg weakness and is diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Enter this patient as an inpatient stroke and select "Aphasia/Language Disturbance" and "Weakness/Paresis".

Summary of Changes

OPTIONAL: Ambulatory status on admission

Indicate the patient's current ambulatory status in the context of their stroke/TIA symptoms. This should be based on the examination in the ER or within the first 24 hours of admission. For patients that are not permitted to ambulate, answer this data element based on what the patient would be capable of if allowed to ambulate.

Able to ambulate independently (no help from another person) w/ or w/o device
With assistance (from person)
Unable to ambulate
ND
Notes for Abstraction:

Able to ambulate independently (no help from another person) w/ or w/o device: Patient ambulating without assistance (no help from another person) with or without a device. This means patient is able to ambulate without help from another person. The use of a device, such as a cane, still meets this definition.
With assistance (from person): Patient ambulating with assistance of another person.
Unable to ambulate: Patient is unable to ambulate safely.
ND: If it is unable to determine from documentation.
For inpatient strokes, enter the patients ambulatory status on arrival to the ED or within 24 hours of actual hospital admission. 
Examples:

Patient 100a is evaluated in the ER and is noted to require maximum 2 person assist to stand at the side of the bed and is noted to be unsafe to ambulate without assistance. Select "Unable to ambulate".
Patient 100b is noted to have facial weakness and slurred speech, but is able to ambulate independently. Select "Able to ambulate independently".
Patient 100c has mild right leg weakness and is unsteady standing independently but is able to walk safely with minimal support of his hand by the nurse. Select "With assistance from another person"
Patient 100d is confined to bed rest post-procedure (i.e. femoral artery puncture). The patient is capable of independent ambulation but is not permitted to do so. Select “Able to ambulate independently (no help from another person) w/ or w/o device.”

OPTIONAL COMPREHENSIVE: First Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used to measure severity of intracerebral hemorrhage. It has been shown to be a predictor of outcome from the bleed. The GCS should be collected on all patients who present with an intracerebral hemorrhage.

Notes for Abstraction:

Record the first GCS documented. This can either be the one completed by EMS, or if not completed by EMS then the first one done in the hospital.
Record GCS scores for eye, verbal, and motor response. The total score will automatically be generated. If patient has endotracheal tube in place at the time GCS measured, check "intubated" and leave the verbal score blank.
If only a total score is documented, only fill in "Total GCS" score and leave the sub-components blank.
If the patient has not suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage, this field will be disabled.
Example: A patient is admitted with a large intracerebral hemorrhage. His eyes open to painful stimuli (2 points), his best motor response is to localize pain to painful stimuli (5 points) and his best verbal response is no response (1 point). His Glasgow Coma Score is 8.

Element definition from The Joint Commission Comprehensive Stroke Performance Measurement Implementation Guide

Data Element Name: Initial ICH Score Performed

Collected For: CSTK-03

Definition: Documentation of the first ICH score that was done at this hospital. The ICH Score is a clinical grading scale composed of factors related to a basic neurological examination (GCS), a baseline patient characteristic (age), and initial neuroimaging (ICH volume, IVH, infratentorial/supratentorial origin). Score documentation may range from 0 to 6. The purpose of this grading scale is to provide a standard assessment tool that can be easily and rapidly determined at the time of ICH presentation by physicians without special training in stroke neurology and that will allow consistency in communication and treatment selection in clinical care and clinical research.

Notes for Abstraction:

Use the date that the ICH score was first performed. If a discrepancy exists in date documentation from different sources, choose the earliest date. If there are two or more initial ICH score dates (either different ICH assessments or corresponding with the same assessment), enter the earliest date.
If the initial ICH score date is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD. 
Example:
Documentation indicates the initial ICH score date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the initial ICH score date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Day, it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select UTD. 
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for Initial ICH Score Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
Use the time for which the ICH score was first performed. If a discrepancy exists in time documentation from different sources, choose the earliest time. If there are two or more different initial ICH score times (either different ICH assessments or corresponding with the same assessment), enter the earliest time.
If the time of the first ICH score is a time prior to hospital arrival because the score was obtained by teleneurology or MD/APN/PA directly receiving the patient via life flight, use the Arrival Time for the score time.
For times that include seconds, remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00
Initial ICH Score Time refers to the time that the first ICH score was performed. If the time performed is mentioned in the body of a note, select the time performed rather than the time stamp on the note. If the only time documented with the score is the time stamp on the note, then select the time stamped. Examples:
Documentation indicates that the initial ICH score was done at 0920. Time stamp on the note is 1159. The abstractor should select 0920 for Initial ICH Score Time.
Documentation indicates that the ICH score done on arrival was 5. Patient arrived at your hospital 2100. Time stamp on the note is 2136. The abstractor should select 2100 for Initial ICH Score Time.
ICH score 5 [no time] documented. Time stamp on the note is 1513. The abstractor should select “1513 for Initial ICH Score Time.
Do not use physician orders as they do not demonstrate the ICH score was done (in the ED this may be used if signed/initialed by a nurse).
If the time of the first ICH score is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD. 
Example:
Documentation indicates the initial ICH score time was 3300. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid time. Since the initial ICH score time is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Hour, it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select UTD.

Notes for Abstraction:

The purpose of this data element is to identify the earliest possible time that stroke symptoms began. This is sometimes known as "Onset Time" although the use of this term has been confusing to many in the past. If a patient experiences the onset of their symptoms in the company of another individual who can verify that the patient was functioning normally up until the time of start of symptoms, then in this patient the time "last known well" is also the time of symptom discovery. In many cases, however, no one is present at the exact start of symptoms. In this situation, we need to document the time when symptoms were first discovered (time of symptom discovery) as well as the time that the patient was last known to be well or at their baseline (time last known well), and record both of these.
The time last known well should be the time closest to the time of discovery for which we have clear evidence that the patient was at their previous baseline. Depending on the type of stroke symptoms, this might be established by a telephone or in person conversation. Family members, EMS personnel, and others, often mistakenly record the time of symptom discovery as the time the patient was last known well. It is imperative to distinguish these two times to avoid inappropriate use of IV t-PA (Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator) in patients who are recently discovered to have symptoms but are many hours (>3 hrs) from their time of last being well.
If a stroke "onset time" is listed in the medical record, without reference to the circumstances preceding its detection, then it should be assumed to be the time "last known well". Enter this time in the specified format.
If there is a specific reference to the patient having been discovered with symptoms already present, then this "onset time" should be treated as a "time of symptom discovery" rather than a time of "last known well". If no time of "last known well" can be determined, then "Unknown" should be selected for time "last known well".
When a time of discovery is documented, but the start of stroke symptoms is not witnessed and no time "last known well" is documented, then "Unknown" should be selected for time "last known well".
When the start of stroke symptoms is clearly witnessed, then the time "last known well" is identical to the time of symptom discovery.
If the time of "last known well" is documented as being a specific number of hours prior to arrival (e.g., 2 hours ago) rather than a calendar time, subtract that number from the time of hospital or ED arrival and enter that time as the time "last known well."
If the time of "last known well" is noted to be a range of time prior to hospital or ED arrival (e.g., "2 - 3 hours ago"), assume the maximum time from the range (e.g., 3 hours), and subtract that number of hours from the time of arrival to compute the time "last known well".
If there are multiple times of "last known well" documented, either because subsequent more accurate information became available or because of different levels of expertise in sorting out the actual time of "last known well", use the time recorded according to the following hierarchy:
neurology
admitting physician
emergency department physician
ED nursing notes
EMS
If multiple date/times of last know well are documented by the same provider, use the earliest date recorded by that provider.
The purpose of 'last known well' is to conservatively identify/estimate time of symptom onset. Use "last known well" to identify when the patient was either last seen or last known to be well (well means at the patient's baseline or usual state of health). This may change with various observers. If the last known well time cannot be identified, then indicate that last known well time and/or date is not known.
In certain selected cases, patients may have transient symptoms which resolve and are later followed by symptoms that do not resolve and result in admission to the hospital. If there is documentation of one or more symptomatic episodes of transient stroke symptoms and documentation of symptom resolution between episodes (e.g. patient returns to baseline), then enter the date/time of the most recent (last) episode here (even if it occurs after hospital arrival and prior to hospital admission).  The following terms may be used as documentation that a patient has experienced transient symptoms and has subsequently returned to baseline:
“baseline”; “symptoms resolved/symptom free/no further symptoms”;  “without further stroke symptoms”; “complete reversal of symptoms”; “NIHSS = 0”; “resolved TIA”; “deficit free/no deficits”.
The following terms would constitute documentation of recurrence of stroke symptoms. 
“symptoms returned;” “new onset of symptoms;” “recurrence of symptoms;” “increase NIHSS”.
Example:  Patient with right sided weakness at home on 08/31/2012 at 0800.  Upon arrival to the hospital, physician documents that the patient is symptom free and documents an NIHSS of zero.  Facial droop noted at 1030 while the patient is in the ED.  Repeat NIHSS performed and documented as 3.  Enter date/time of 08/31/2012 1030.
TJC/CM User Note: Adjustments need to be made on the Core Measure tab for patients with transient symptoms that fully resolve and later return. Per TJC, you should enter the earliest last known well for this type of patient (those that have transient symptoms that fully resolve and later return while in the ED). Per STK-4 specifications, time last known well must be before the arrival time or the patient will be assigned to category 'X' for missing/invalid data. In order to meet both GWTG and TJC definitions, for cases such as these, click into the Core Measure tab and change the auto populated response for the data element "What was the date and time at which the patient was last known to be well or at his or her baseline state of health?" to the earliest time recorded following the appropriate hierarchy.
Examples:

Patient 140a arrived in ED via EMS on 12/10/20XX at 14:43 accompanied by her daughter. Her daughter states that patient was found at 2:00 pm "in her chair slumped over, I couldn't understand what she was saying and she was drooling from her mouth - and her face didn't look right." On further questioning by the neurologist, the daughter says her mother ate lunch at 12:30 pm and then went to sit in her chair where she was later found as noted above. Date and Time of last known well are known as 12/10/20XX 12:30, and Date and Time of discovery are known as 12/10/20XX 14:00.
Patient 140b arrived in the ED with his son on 11/10/20XX 8:09 am. His son states that he last saw his father last night at 8:30 pm. His father lives alone. His father woke up this morning about 6:30 am and noticed that his right arm was weak. It did not get better, so patient called his son at 7:00 am, who came over right away and was concerned that his father was having a stroke, but his father could walk and talk OK. Daughter arrives and states that she had talked to her father on the phone last night around 9:30 pm and that he didn't mention anything about a problem with his arm. Date and Time of last known well are known as 11/09/20XX 21:30, and Date and Time of discovery are known as 11/10/20XX 06:30.
Patient 140c was eating dinner with his wife tonight after they finished watching the nightly news on TV "when his arm began shaking and he couldn't hold onto his fork or his water glass or anything. He has never done this before." Their nightly news show is on from 6:00 to 6:30 pm. She called the ambulance right away. ED arrival date and time is 11/29/20XX 7:53 pm. Date and Time of last known well are known as 11/29/20XX 18:30, and date of discovery is known as 11/29/20XX with an unknown time. There is no reference to time of discovery in this scenario, so it remains unknown to the abstractor. Above the Date/Time field, select "MM/DD/YYYY" and just enter 11/29/20XX.
Patient 140d states she has been having numbness come and go in her left arm for the past week, but it always went away. Today the numbness started about 4 hours before she came to the ED and didn't go away so she decided to get it checked. She thinks her arm isn't completely numb, but it feels heavy, and she can't hold a pen tightly. ED arrival time is 5:15 pm on 09/09/20XX. Date and Time of last known well are known as 09/09/20XX 13:15, and Date and Time of discovery are known as 09/09/20XX 13:15.
Patient 140e was found on the floor beside the commode by the charge nurse at Starlight Nursing Home on her night rounds at 12:45 am on 12/01/20XX. He wasn't able to talk or move, but his left leg was shaking. He is normally quite alert and normally walks with his walker. Date and Time of last known well are known as 11/30/20XX 21:00, and Date and Time of discovery are known as 12/01/20XX 00:45.
A 58 y/o woman was last known normal at 7:00 pm and was found at 7:30 pm with right hemiparesis and aphasia. She is transferred to your hospital from another hospital having IV t-PA initiated on 06/10/20XX at 9:30 pm and arrived at your hospital at 10:15 pm. Date and Time of last known well are known as 06/10/20XX 19:00, and Date and Time of discovery are known as 06/10/20XX 19:30.
A 55 year old male had a brief episode of slurred speech at 6am on 5/10/20XX. The episode resolved quickly and he returned completely to normal. At Noon on that same day (5/10/20XX) he developed one sided weakness and slurred speech which persisted when he arrived to your hospital. Date and Time of last known well are known as 5/10/20XX 12:00.

REQUIRED: Date/Time of discovery of stroke symptoms? (When was the patient first discovered to have the current stroke symptoms?)

Indicate the date and time of discovery of patient's symptoms (i.e., when the patient was found with symptoms). This should be the earliest time that patient was known to have symptoms. This date and time should not vary. If the event was witnessed, then the last known well date and time and the discovery date and time will be identical. Record both, even if identical (checking the box for Time of Discovery same as Last Known Well will automatically set the discovery Date/Time with the same Date/Time as "last known well".)

REQUIRED: Brain imaging completed at your hospital for this episode of care?

(Was brain imaging performed at your hospital after arrival as part of the initial evaluation for this episode of care or this event?)

Yes: Patient did receive brain imaging at your hospital/facility for this event
No/ND: Patient did not receive any brain imaging at your hospital/facility or did not receive imaging at an outside hospital prior to transfer
NC: Patient had outside brain imaging prior to transfer from another hospital, and results for that imaging are recorded in the record
Notes for Abstraction:

This data element is looking to capture information around the initial brain image for this event (regardless if it is done at your facility or not). If a second brain image is completed at your hospital, after an initial imaging has been completed at an outside hospital, you would still select NC here and would record the findings of the initial brain image that was performed at the outside facility under Interpretation of first brain image after symptom onset, done at any facility.
For inpatient stroke, use the first brain image performed after discovery of stroke symptoms in the hospital. If patient had brain imaging performed in the hospital prior to stroke symptom onset, use the brain imaging performed after discovery of stroke symptoms in the hospital.
If the patient arrives to the hospital with transient symptoms that resolve and brain imaging is completed, but later in the hospital stay the patient has new onset stroke symptoms and meets criteria to be entered as an inpatient stroke, new brain imaging should be performed.  If new brain imaging is not performed, select "No/ND."  Do NOT use brain imaging performed for the prior resolved event. 
Example: Patient 150a presented to the ED with a brief episode of slurred speech. The patient had a CT and lab tests completed. Symptoms completely resolved while in the ED and the patient was discharged from the ED with complete recovery of neurological symptoms. The patient returned to the ED 3 hours later and no repeat CT or lab tests were completed, but the previous CT and labs are used to determine course of treatment. Select NC for Brain Imaging Completed at this hospital.

Useful Background Information form 2013 AHA/ASA Guidelines: 
CT Angiography 
Helical CT angiography (CTA) provides a means to rapidly and noninvasively evaluate the intracranial and extracranial vasculature in acute, subacute, and chronic stroke settings and thus to provide potentially important information about the presence of vessel occlusions or stenoses. The accuracy of CTA for evaluation of large-vessel intracranial stenoses and occlusions is very high and in some cases its overall accuracy approaches or exceeds that of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). 
The sensitivity and specificity of CTA for the detection of intracranial occlusions ranges between 92% and 100% and between 82% and 100%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 91% to 100%. 
Because CTA provides a static image of vascular anatomy, it is inferior to DSA for the demonstration of flow rates and direction. 

MR Angiography 
Intracranial MR angiography (MRA) is performed in combination with brain MRI in the setting of acute stroke to guide therapeutic decision making. There are several different MRA techniques that are used for imaging intracranial vessels. 
They include 2-dimensional time of flight (TOF), 3-dimensional TOF, multiple overlapping thin-slab acquisition, and contrast-enhanced MRA. 
Intracranial MRA with nonenhanced TOF techniques has a sensitivity ranging from 60% to 85% for stenoses and from 80% to 90% for occlusions compared with CTA or DSA. 
Typically, TOF MRA is useful in identifying acute proximal large-vessel occlusions but cannot reliably identify distal or branch occlusions. 

Digital Subtraction Angiography 
DSA remains the "gold standard" for the detection of many types of cerebrovascular lesions and diseases. For most types of cerebrovascular disease, the resolution, sensitivity, and specificity of DSA equal or exceed those of the noninvasive techniques, including for arterial stenoses. 
However, if noninvasive imaging provides firm diagnostic findings, cerebral angiography may not be required. 
DSA is an invasive test and most likely will not be the initial imaging modality for emergency intracerebral evaluation of large-vessel occlusion in stroke because of the time necessary to perform the examination; a CTA or MRA can be performed in an additional 2 to 4 minutes during initial stroke evaluation (in a multimodal evaluation in process) and can obviate the need for catheter angiography.

Required field for TJC or CSTK or users that have the "Advanced Stroke Care Tab" enabled 

Definition: Record if a proximal large vessel occlusion (LVO) was identified upon reviewing the advanced brain imaging (e.g. CTA, MRA, DSA). Intent of the question is to determine if patient had a large vessel intracranial occlusion in the imaging. 

Additional Information: 2015 Endovascular Guidelines: For patients who otherwise meet criteria for endovascular treatment, a noninvasive intracranial vascular study is recommended during the initial imaging evaluation of the acute stroke patient, but should not delay IV alteplase if indicated. 

Data Collection Question: Was there a presence of a large vessel occlusion upon reviewing the vascular imaging (e.g. CTA)? 

Format: Single-Select 

Allowable Values:
Yes: There was presence of large vessel occlusions identified (or visualized) upon reviewing the vascular imaging.
No/ND: There were no large vessel occlusions identified (or visualized) upon reviewing the vascular imaging ORNo documentation in the medical record that indicates presence of large vessel occlusion for vascular imaging completed for this episode of care.


Notes for Abstraction:
An occlusion is 100% stenosis.
A "target lesion" is referring to a proximal large vessel occlusion.
A larget-vessel occlusion typically causes severe stroke and independently predicts poor neurological outcome, and is a stronger predictor of "neurological deterioration." Thus, detection of large-vessel occlusion by means of noninvasive intracranial vascular imaging greatly improves the ability to make appropirate clinical decisions.

Notes for Abstraction:

Arrival may be classified as the time that evaluation and management by the stroke team first began. This may be in-person at the bedside, by telephone, or by telemedicine (as per protocol).
A telephone call acknowledging that the stroke team has been consulted does not qualify as evaluation and management by the stroke team.
Select "NA" if the patient was not evaluated by members of the stroke team.
Examples:

Patient presents to the ED on 02/25/20XX at 09:55am and is seen by the triage nurse and then by the ED resident, who is NOT part of the acute stroke team. The resident makes the decision to activate a stroke alert. The stroke team is paged, and the stroke nurse calls back at 10:05am to acknowledge that the team is coming to the ED. The stroke team nurse arrives in the ED at 10:10am and the Neurologist arrives at 10:12am. The date time/time of stroke team arrival should be documented as 8/31/20XX 10:10.
Patient arrives in the ED on 08/10/20XX at 11:05am. The ED physician evaluates the patient at 11:10am and calls the neurologist at home at 11:15am to discuss the case and receive recommendations. The date/time stroke team arrival should be documented as 08/10/20XX 11:15.

Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 0-3hr treatment window?
Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 3-4.5hr treatment window?
Additional Warnings 3-4.5 hrs
Hospital-related or Other Factors (0-3 hr and 3-4.5 hr treatment windows)
Specify Other Reason for no- IV thrombolytic (0-3 and 3-4.5 hr treatment windows)
If IV tPA was initiated greater than 60 minutes after hospital arrival, were Eligibility or Medical reason(s) documented as the cause for delay
IV tPA at an outside hospital or EMS / Mobile Stroke Unit?
Investigational or experimental protocol for thrombolysis
Additional Comments Related to Thrombolytics
If no documented eligibility or medical reason(s), Hospital Related or Other Reason(s):
REQUIRED: IV thrombolytic therapy initiated at this hospital?

Indicate whether IV tPA (Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator) was initiated at your hospital.

Yes: IV tPA (IV thrombolytic) initiated at this hospital.
No: IV tPA (IV thrombolytic) was not initiated at this hospital (even if there are documented contraindications or warnings to IV tPA) OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.
Notes for Abstraction:

Thrombolytic Therapy for stroke includes:
Activase
Alteplase
IV t-PA
Recombinant t-PA Tissue plasminogen activator
When a "hang time" or "infusion time" for IV thrombolytic is documented in the medical record, select "Yes".
If a patient begins treatment with IV tPA, but does not get the full dose due to a medical reason like an elevated INR or a newly discovered history element, select "Yes".
If patient received IV tPA in the ED in your hospital and was then transferred from your ED (without hospital admission) to another acute care hospital, select "Yes" here and select "Yes, not admitted" for "Not Admitted?" This will allow you to capture the "drip and ship patient and disable non-relevant questions. See instructions for "Not Admitted?"
If IV thrombolytic therapy was administered at another hospital and patient was subsequently transferred to this hospital, select “No”.
If the patient was transferred to this hospital with IV thrombolytic infusing, select “No”.
In the case that tPA is contraindicated, and the patient does not receive IV tPA at this hospital, select "No" for IV tPA initiated at this hospital and select "Yes" for Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in either the 0-3 hour or 3-4.5 hour treatment window. Please note the previous use of the NC choice has been replaced by separate Yes/No questions for documented contraindications and warnings.
It is essential that documented contraindications or warnings for non-treatment be selected when applicable for both the 0-3 and the 3-4.5 hour windows since the actual contraindications and warnings may differ between the two windows.
Do not include thrombolytic therapy for indications other than ischemic stroke. That is, do not include intra-cerebral venous infusion for cerebral venous thrombosis, intraventricular infusion for intraventricular hemorrhage, intraparenchymal infusion for percutaneous aspiration of intracerebral hematoma, myocardial infarction, PE, or peripheral clot.
Currently, t-PA is the only FDA-approved IV thrombolytic.
Note: IV tPA is not FDA approved for use in the 3-4.5 hour window, but there is a Class 1A level guideline from the AHA regarding this treatment. There is a Quality report available to assist tracking performance on this measure.

Summary of Changes
REQUIRED: Date/Time IV tPA initiated (at this hospital or ED)

If IV tPA was initiated at this hospital or ED, record the date and time that IV tPA was initiated (time of bolus administration). If there are discrepancies in the documentation of bolus administration, the nursing documentation on the medication administration sheets or hospital approved electronic system should be treated as the most reliable source, followed by the stroke physician's documented time or ED note. If multiple dates/times are documented by the same individual, use the earliest date recorded by that person.

Please note, this time of treatment is used to control skip logic related to contraindications, warnings, etc related to non-treatment, so it is critical to enter the correct date/time here. If the data elements are not appearing as expected, please check that the date/time is abstracted accurately.

Notes for Abstraction:

This data element applies only to patients for whom IV thrombolytic therapy was initiated at this hospital. Do not abstract this data element if IV thrombolytic therapy was initiated at another hospital and patient was subsequently transferred to this hospital.
IV t-PA is the only FDA-approved IV thrombolytic therapy.
Example: For Patient 170a, the nursing documentation indicates that a bolus of IV tPA occurred at 1300 and that there was a 10 minute delay in finding an infusion pump, so infusion started at 1310. Record the Date and Time of IV tPA Initiated as 1300.

Data Element Name: IV Thrombolytic Initiation Date/Time

Collected For: CSTK-05

Definition: The month, date, year, and time (military time) that IV thrombolytic therapy was initiated to a patient with ischemic stroke at this hospital. IV thrombolytics convert plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn breaks down fibrin and fibrinogen, thereby dissolving thrombus.

Suggested Data Collection Question: What is the date and time that IV thrombolytic therapy was initiated for this patient at this hospital?

Format

Length: 10 - MM-DD-YYYY (includes dashes) or UTD, 5 - HH-MM (with or without colon) or UTD
Type: Date/Time
Occurs: 1

Allowable Values: 

MM = Month (01-12)
DD = Day (01-31)
YYYY = Year (2001-Current Year)
UTD = Unable to Determine

HH = Hour (00-23)
MM = Minutes (00-59)
UTD = Unable to Determine

Notes for Abstraction:

Use the date at which initiation of the IV thrombolytic was first documented. If a discrepancy exists in date documentation from different sources, choose the earliest date. If there are two or more different IV thrombolytic initiation dates (either different IV thrombolytic episodes or corresponding with the same episode), enter the earliest date.
If the date IV thrombolytic therapy was initiated is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD.
Example:
Documentation indicates the IV thrombolytic initiation date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the IV thrombolytic initiation date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Day, it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select UTD. 
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for IV Thrombolytic Initiation Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse
Use the time at which initiation of the IV thrombolytic was first documented. If a discrepancy exists in time documentation from different sources, choose the earliest time. If there are two or more different IV thrombolytic initiation times (either different IV thrombolytic episodes or corresponding with the same episode), enter the earliest time.
For times that include seconds, remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00
The use of hang time or infusion time is acceptable as IV thrombolytic initiation time when other documentation cannot be found.
IV thrombolytic initiation time refers to the time the thrombolytic bolus/infusion was started.
Do not use physician orders as they do not demonstrate initiation of the IV thrombolytic (in the ED this may be used if signed/initialed by a nurse).
If the time of IV thrombolytic initiation is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD.
Example:
Documentation indicates the IV thrombolytic initiation time was 3300. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid time. Since the IV thrombolytic initiation time is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Hour, it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select UTD. 
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid time as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for IV Thrombolytic Initiation Time allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.

Summary of Changes

REQUIRED: Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 0-3hr treatment window?

Yes: There is a documented contraindication or warning for not initiating IV tPA in the 0 - 3 hour treatment window.
No: There are no specific reasons documented in the medical record why IV tPA was not administered or a hospital-related factor or other reason was present which may or may not be documented but was apparent to the abstractor. This (hospital-related factor or other reason) is the only section where it may be proper to infer reasons for non-treatment and is provided to assist in quality improvement activities.
It is not expected that in routine situations the physician will explicitly identify which contraindications or warnings were relevant to the 0-3 or 3-4.5 hour window. Most likely, this will only be documented when different reasons were relevant to the decision for the two time windows.

See examples under Documented Reasons in the medical record for no IV t-PA started at your hospital.

Notes for Abstraction:

In order to select “Yes,” reasons for not initiating IV thrombolytic therapy must be documented by a physician/APN/PA and mentioned in the context of IV thrombolytics and fall on the Exclusion Criteria (contraindications) and/or Relative Exclusion Criteria (warnings).
Patient/family refusal, NIHSS score of zero, and initiation of IV or IA thrombolytic at a transferring hospital may be documented by a nurse.
If the reason documented for non-treatment with IV thrombolytics does not fall into one of the response options on the Exclusion Criteria(0-3hr) or Relative Exclusion Criteria(0-3hr) lists below, select “No” here.
Documentation of the initiation of IV or IA thrombolytic at a transferring hospital is a stand-alone reason and sufficient to meet the intent of this data element. No further documentation of it as the reason for not initiating IV t-PA at this hospital is needed in order to select “Yes” here.
If documentation indicates a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of zero, select “Yes” to Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic and choose Relative Exclusion Criteria “Stroke severity too mild” under Warnings . Score documentation must refer to the timeframe for thrombolytic therapy.
For additional clarity, see examples under Documented Reasons in the medical record for no IV t-PA started at your hospital.
Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures note for TJC/CM users: The data element of documented reasons for not initiating IV thrombolytic on the Core Measures tab allows for inclusion of alternate reasons documented by physician/APN/PA or pharmacist beyond those listed on the Exclusions Criteria and Relative Exclusion Criteria lists below as long as the reasons are mentioned in the context of IV thrombolytics. If there is documentation in the medical record of an alternate reason for not initiating IV thrombolytic (e.g. a reason that is not on the Exclusion Criteria and/or Relative Exclusion Criteria lists below) and that reason is linked to IV thrombolytics you may need to adjust the auto-populated response on the Core Measures tab. To do so, just click into that tab to view the exact definition from the Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures and adjust your response if appropriate.
Examples:

Ischemic stroke patient has a history of seizures and is taking anti-convulsants. The family states that the patient had twitching of his arm before he became aphasic. The doctor documents the possibility of seizure with residual neurological symptoms as the reason for non-treatment with IV tPA. Select “Yes” for Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 0-3hr treatment window. Also select Exclusion Criteria "Seizure at onset" (0-3hr treatment window).
Patient with history of metastatic breast cancer and a life expectancy of nine months presents with an ischemic stroke one hour after last known well. Documentation never mentions IV thrombolytic therapy. Select “No” for Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 0-3hr treatment window?. The reason for non-treatment was never documented in the context of IV thrombolytics in this case. As the abstractor may have inferred that the reason for non-treatment was due to the patient’s co-morbid condition and limited life expectancy, you may select “Other” under Hospital-Related or Other Factors (0-3hr treatment window) and specify the reason for non-treatment there.
Patient presents with a headache that has persisted for 1 hour and 45 minutes. The patient is seen by an ED physician who believes that the patient has a migraine. The patient is seen by a neurologist several hours later, and after further work-up, is determined to have an ischemic stroke. Medical record documentation by the neurologist states “patient was not a candidate for IV tPA, as by the time he was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke, 8 hours had passed since he was last known to be well.” Select Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 0-3hr treatment window = “No.” A lthough there is documentation around thrombolytic therapy in the record, the reason for non-treatment does not fall on the Exclusion Crtieria or Relative Exclusion Criteria lists. In this case, the abstractor should select Hospital-Related or Other Factors (0-3hr treatment window) = “Delay in Stroke Diagnosis.”
OPTIONAL: Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 3-4.5hr treatment window?

Yes: There is a documented contraindication or warning for not initiating IV tPA in the 3 - 4.5 hour treatment window.
No: There are no specific reasons documented in the medical record why IV tPA was not administered or if a hospital-related factor or other reason was present which may or may not be documented but was apparent to the abstractor. This (hospital-related factor or other reason) is the only section where it may be proper to infer reasons for non-treatment and is provided to assist in quality improvement activities.
It is not expected that in routine situations the physician will explicitly identify which contraindications or warnings were relevant to the 0-3 or 3-4.5 hour window. Most likely, this will only be documented when different reasons were relevant to the decision for the two time windows.

The following lists include contraindications and warnings which have been taken from the clinical practice guidelines. The reasons provided herein are not intended to supersede physician judgment, but serve as a guideline to abstractors. As always, the physician must exercise due caution in providing treatment, given the risks and benefits to the individual patient and the available information at the time of treatment decision. For further guidance on what kind of patients should or should not be treated with IV t-PA, refer to "Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Guideline for Healthcare Professional From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.” See Table 3 for a listing of Characteristics of Patients with Ischemic Stroke Who Could Be Treated With rtPA within the 0 - 3 hour time window, taken from the Guidelines. Please also refer to the "Scientific Rationale for the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Intravenous Atleplase in Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Statement for Healthcare Professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.” which provides further clarification and recommendations for tPA use in specific patient populations, including advanced age and stroke severity.

Exclusion Criteria (contraindications) (0-3 hr and 3-4.5 hr treatment windows):

Elevated blood pressure (systolic > 185 mm Hg or diastolic > 110 mm Hg) despite treatment
Recent intracranial or spinal surgery or significant head trauma, or prior stroke in previous 3 months
History of previous intracranial hemorrhage, intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm
Active internal bleeding
Acute bleeding diathesis (low platelet count, increased PTT, INR ≥ 1.7 or use of NOAC). This includes: Platelet count <100 000/mm3; Heparin received within 48 hours, resulting in abnormally elevated aPTT greater than the limit or normal; current use of anticoagulant with INR >1.7 or PT >15 seconds; current use of direct thrombin inhibitors or direct factor Xa inhibitors with elevated sensitive laboratory tests (such as aPTT, INR, platelet ocunt, and ECT; TT; or appropriate factor Xa activity assays)
Symptoms suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage
CT demonstrates multilobar infarction (hypodensity >1/3 cerebral hemisphere)
Arterial puncture at noncompressible site in previous 7 days
Blood glucose concentration <50 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L)
Relative Exclusion Criteria (warnings) (0-3 hr and 3-4.5 hr treatment windows):

Recent experience suggests that under some circumstances- with careful consideration and weighting of risk to benefit- patients may receive fibrinolytic therapy despite 1 or more relative contraindications. Consider risk to benefit of IV rtPA administration carefully if any of these relative exclusion criteria are present:

Care-team unable to determine eligibility
IV or IA thrombolysis/thrombectomy at an outside hospital prior to arrival
Life expectancy < 1 year or severe co-morbid illness or CMO on admission
Pregnancy
Patient/Family refusal
Rapid improvement
Stroke severity too mild
Recent acute myocardial infarction (within previous 3 months)
Seizure at onset with postictal residual neurological impairments
Major surgery or serious trauma withinin previous 14 days
Recent gastroinestinal or urinary tract hemorrhage (within previous 21 days)
Notes for Abstraction:

Reasons for not initiating IV thrombolytic therapy must be documented by a physician/APN/PA or pharmacist with three exceptions: Patient/family refusal, NIHSS score of zero, and initiation of IV or IA thrombolytic at a transferring hospital. These three exceptions may be documented by a nurse. Reason documentation must refer to the timeframe for thrombolytic therapy.
Exclusions and/or relative exclusions (contraindications and/or warnings) must be mentioned in the context of IV thrombolytics. It is the intent that the abstractor will not make inference as to the reason for non-treatment based upon the presence of certain patient clinical characteristics and conditions in the record, but will only abstract reasons that are specifically documented in the medical record as the reason for not giving thrombolytic therapy. If reasons are not mentioned in the context of IV thrombolytics, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that IV thrombolytic was not initiated because of a bleeding disorder unless documentation explicitly states so.)
Documentation of the initiation of IV or IA thrombolytic at a transferring hospital is a stand-alone reason and sufficient to meet the intent of this data element. No further documentation of it as the reason for not initiating IV t-PA at this hospital is needed.
If documentation indicates a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of zero, select “Yes” to Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic and choose “Stroke severity too mild” here . Score documentation must refer to the timeframe for thrombolytic therapy.
It is not acceptable to use documentation from outside physician or nurse notes that played a factor in the decision-making process for not giving thrombolytic therapy. EXCEPTION: If your hospital uses telemedicine in assessing stroke patients, it is acceptable to select reasons specified by the teleneurologist when reasons are documented in the medical record. In these cases, it is acceptable for the documentation to be done by a nurse.
It is permissible to abstract reasons for non-treatment from the medical record that are documented after the IV tPA treatment decision has been made as long as the documentation is made prior to patient discharge (addendums cannot be made after discharge). Documented reason must refer to the timeframe for thrombolytic therapy.   Suggested data sources: consultation notes, ED records, H&P, MAR, progress notes (exclusion: discharge summary).
It is essential that documented reasons for non-treatment be selected for both the 0-3 and the 3-4.5 hour treatment windows when applicable since the reasons may differ between the two windows. Due to the dynamic nature of acute stroke symptoms and patient response to interventions (e.g. blood pressure control), patients who are not eligible for treatment in the first three hours may become eligible in the later window and should still be considered for treatment. Click here to reference the new guideline update from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association regarding the Expansion of the Time Window for Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke With Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator. (link is http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/STROKEAHA.109.192535 )
It is not expected that in routine situations the physician will explicitly identify which contraindication(s) and/or warning(s) were relevant to the 0-3 or 3-4.5 hour window. Most likely, this will only be documented when different reasons were relevant to the decision for the two time windows. If contraindication(s) and/or warning(s) for non-treatment are documented for the 0-3 hour treatment window, it is acceptable to assume the same reason(s) for non-treatment to be valid for the 3-4.5 hour window unless documentation in the medical record indicates the patients clinical condition changed. (e.g. If SBP > 185 or DBP > 110 mmHg, Stroke Severity too mild, Stroke Severity too severe, Rapid improvement, or Care Team Unable to determine eligibility are documented as the reason(s) for not administering IV tPA in the 0-3 hour time window, and there is documentation of a change in clinical status within 4.5 hours in the medical record then you should not assume that the same reason for non-treatment remains in the extended time window. In these situations, there must be specific documentation around the reason for non-treatment in the 3-4.5 hour window.
Examples:

An ischemic stroke patient presents within 2 hours of Last Known Well with SBP of 220. Physician documents “no tPA due to elevated Blood Pressure.” With treatment, the patient’s SBP is brought down to 150 at 3.5 hours after Last Known Well but there is no additional documentation in the medical record with regards to thrombolytic treatment. Select “Yes” to “Documented Contraindications or warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 0-3hr treatment window” and then choose “C1: SBP> 185 or DBP > 110 mmHg despite treatment.” Select “No” to “Documented Contraindications or warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 3-4.5hr treatment window.”
An ischemic stroke patient presents within 2 hours of Last Known Well with an NIHSS of 29. Physician documents “no tPA due to elevated NIHSS.” There's documentation in the medical record of an NIHSS=26 at 3.5 hours after Last Known Well and the physician documents that the patient is not a candidate for tPA in the extended time window due to NIHSS>25. Select “No” to “Documented Contraindications or warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 0-3hr treatment window”. There is no stroke severity limit or NIHSS limit for treatment in the 0-3 hour window. Select “Yes” to “Documented Contraindications or warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 3-4.5hr treatment window” and then choose “AW4: Severe Stroke Severity NIHSS >25”
An ischemic stroke patient presents with an unclear onset time. Physician documents “timing of stroke symptom onset is unclear therefore no tPA at this time”. One hour later the patient’s daughter arrives and states that her father was well 3 hours prior and had no stroke symptoms. There is no further documentation in the medical record around tPA. Select “Yes” to “Documented Contraindications or warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 0-3hr treatment window” and then choose Exclusion Criteria “Care team unable to determine eligibility” (0-3 hr treatment window). Select “No” to “Documented Contraindications or warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic in the 3-4.5hr treatment window.
The following should help abstractors in classifying reasons:

If the patient is on anticoagulants (Warfarin, Coumadin) and this is documented as the reason for not administering IV thrombolytics, and the PT, PTT, or INR is elevated, select Exclusion Criteria “Acute bleeding diathesis. Use of anticoagulants without reference to INR is an Additional Exclusion Criteria for the 3-4.5 treatment window – “ Taking oral anticoagulants regardless of INR”.
Conditions that increase the risk of bleeding or decrease the benefit of treatment to the individual patient must be explicitly listed in the medical record and documented as being the reason that thrombolytics were not used. Conditions may include: Acute pericarditis, SBE (spontaneous bacterial endocarditis), Hemostatic defects, Diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy, Septic thrombophlebitis, occluded AV cannula, or patient is currently receiving oral anticoagulants (e.g., Warfarin, therapeutic dose of dabigatran (Pradaxa).
Advanced age alone is no longer considered a sufficient reason for not providing tPA in the 0-3 hour window. There is sufficient evidence from subgroup analysis of the randomized trials to conclude that beneficial effects of tPA are seen in advanced age when patients are treated with 0-3 hours, and the Scientific Rationale for the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Intravenous Alteplase in Acue Ischemic Stroke: A Statement for Healthcare Professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends treatment of elderly ischemic stroke patients who meet other criteria, without restriction by age. There is no specific upper age limit on the use of IV tPA. However, the prevalence of other exclusions or relative exclusions to treatment (e.g. other illnesses that reduce life expectancy to <1 year) may be higher in patients with very advanced age, reducing the number of elderly patients who may be eligible for tPA treatment. For patients at 3-4.5 hours, age >80 remains a relative exclusion because such patients were not included in the randomized controlled trial.
"Care-team unable to determine eligibility" means that the diagnosis of stroke was made but that eligibility for thrombolytic therapy could not be established or verified by the clinician. Examples may include:
The time of onset could not be clearly established at the time of patient assessment in the ED or time of Last Known Well is unknown
Timing of a recent procedure or surgery could not be definitively established.
A lack of an accurate history or concern about the presence of a preexisting medical condition raises concern about eligibility for IV thrombolytic therapy.
Patients who have experienced multiple episodes of transient neurologic function, or TIAs, which have fully resolved clinically, but imaging or other features of the history make it uncertain as to when the stroke actually started.
Select "IV or IA tPA given at outside hospital" when a patient was transferred from another hospital where IV tPA was started, even if the infusion continues after the patient arrives at your facility. Explicit documentation stating that "further tPA is not required" is not necessary. It would be acceptable for this to be documented by a nurse.
Select "Life expectancy < 1 year or severe co-morbid illness or CMO on admission" if the patient has an order for Comfort Measures Only in the ED and this restriction of care preceded evaluation for IV tPA. This option is also appropriate when patients are not treated due to coexisting terminal cancer, advanced dementia, severe cardiopulmonary disease or other conditions which severely limit quality of life or life expectancy. Limited life expectancy, severe co-morbid conditions, and CMO status all need to be explicitly documented as the reason for no IV tPA. Do not make inferences.
If the physician documents that the patient declines IV tPA in favor of catheter-based reperfusion or other investigational therapy, select "Pt./Family refused"
Select "Rapid improvement" or "Stroke severity too mild" when symptoms are rapidly improving or there is minimal to no disability associated with the stroke symptoms (e.g. numbness, mild weakness, lack of gait impairment). Note that there is no lower limit to NIHSS score that prohibits the use of IV tPA.
If the physician documents "no IV tPA due to low NIHSS or NIHSS = 3," then this would appropriately be categorized as stroke severity too mild.
If documentation indicates an NIHSS score of zero, then this may be considered the equivalent of documentation that the stroke was too mild, and an explicit statement linking this as the reason for non-treatment is not required.
Select "Severe Stroke NIHSS >25" when the physician notes document “tPA was withheld due to the severity of the stroke symptoms". Note there is no upper limit in terms of NIHSS score that prohibits the use of IV tPA and many centers would still treat a patient with an NIHSS score of 25. Severe stroke is not an exclusion or relative exclusion to treatment at 0-3 hours.
For inpatient stroke, the 0-3 and 3-4.5 hour treatment window is calculated from Symptom Discovery Date/Time -Date/Time Last Known Well.
Examples:

Patient 180a has a history of seizures and is taking anti-convulsants, and the family states that he had twitching of his arm before he became aphasic. The doctor documents the possibility of 'seizure with residual neurological symptoms' as the reason for non-treatment with IV tPA. Select "Seizure at onset with postictal risdual neurological symptoms" as Exclusion Criteria in both 0-3 and 3-4.5 hour treatment window. (Note, the abstractor should also select "No" for " IV tPA initiated at this hospital" and "Yes" for "Documented Contraindications and Warnings for not initiating IV tPA" for both 0-3 and 3-4.5 hour treatment windows.)
Patient 180b is a 95 year old male who presents with aphasia and right-sided weakness. He is not treated with IV tPA and the reason is documented as "increased risk of bleeding due to advanced age". Select "No" for "IV tPA initiated at this hospital"; "No" for "Documented Contraindications and Warnings for not initiating IV tPA" in the 0-3 hour window; "Yes" for "Documented Contraindications and Warnings for not initating IV tPA" in the 3-4.5 hour window; and select "Age>80" for Additional Relative Exclusion Criteria 3- 4.5 hour window.
Patient 180b is a 95 year old male who presents with aphasia and right-sided weakness. He was last seen well 2 hours ago. He was referred from a long term care facility, where he was residing because of advanced dementia. He is not treated with IV tPA and the reason is document as “Not given tPA—too old”. Select "No" for "IV tPA initiated at this hospital" ; "No" for "Documented Contraindications and Warnings for not initiating IV tPA" in the 0-3 hour window; “Yes for "Documented Contraindications and Warnings for not initiating IV tPA" in the 3-4.5 hour window; and Select "Age > 80" for Additional Relative Exclusion Criteria3-4.5 hour window. In this case the patient’s age (95) is a relative exclusion for initiating IV tPA in the 3-4.5 hour window, but not in the 0-3 hour window. Therefore the abstractor must indicate "No" for "Documented Contraindications and Warnings for not initiating IV tPA" in the 0-3 hour window. The abstractor might guess that treatment was not offered at 0-3 hours because of dementia, a severe co-morbid illness; however, inferences are not allowed. If the clinician had instead documented “No tPA—advanced dementia” then the abstractor could have documented “Yes” to “Documented Contraindications and Warnings for not initiating IV tPA" and selected “Life expectancy < 1 year or severe co-morbid illness or CMO on admission”.
Patient 180c came into the ED within 120 minutes of time last known well.  After a head CT, the ED physician recommended to the patient's wife that the patient receive IV-tPA.  The wife wanted to wait to discuss the issue with the daughter, who was driving to the hospital.  The physician documented in the medical record the wife’s refusal of treatment pending discussion with her daughter. When the daughter finally arrived, the patient was outside the 180 min window, and so IV-tPA was initiated in the 3-4.5 hour treatment window. Select "Pt./Family refused" under Warnings in the 0-3 hr treatment window. Note the abstractor would also select "Yes" for "IV tPA initiated at this hospital “and "Yes" for "Documented Contraindications and Warnings for not initiating IV tPA in the 0-3 hour time window". Note because the patient received treatment in the 3-4.5 hour, Contraindications and Warnings in the 3-4.5 hour treatment window will be disabled on the online form).
Patient 180d arrives at the ED at 1hr 50min after Last Known Well. The hospital acute stroke team is consulted and every effort is made to treat him within 3 hours of symptom onset, but the bolus is not started until 3hr 10min after Last Known Well. Because the patient did not receive IV tPA within the first 3 hours and there is no contraindication and/or warning documented for non treatment in the 0-3 hour time window, do NOT select any contraindications or warnings in the 0-3 hour treatment window. Note the abstractor would also select “No” for “Documented contraindications or warnings in the 0-3 hour treatment window” and select the appropriate hospital-related factor that contributed to the delay if applicable. (Note because the patient received treatment in the 3-4.5 hour, Contraindications and Warnings in the 3-4.5 hour treatment window will be disabled on the online form).
Patient 180e arrives within 2 hours from Last Known Well. His NIHSS is 2, due to mild dysarthria and mild drift. The physician documents no IV tPA due to mild stroke. However, at 3hr 15min after Last Known Well, he suddenly worsens to an NIHSS of 10. At this point, the physician reviews the results of his IV tPA evaluation and finds no contraindications or warnings, including the additional warnings for patients beyond the 3 hour window. IV tPA is administered at 3hr 50min after Last Known Well. Select “Stroke severity too mild” under Warnings for the 0-3 hour treatment window. Note that the abstractor would also select “Yes” for “Documented contraindications or warnings in the 0-3 hour time window” (Note because the patient received treatment Contraindications and Warning in the 3-4.5 hour treatment window will be disabled on the online form..
Patient 180f is brought to the ED by his daughter who found him aphasic at home at 4pm. She had last seen him well at 8am that morning. The physician documents no IV tPA due to greater than 4.5 hours since Last Known Well. While the patient is still in the ED, the son who lives at home arrives at 4:30pm and states that he saw his father well at 2:15pm. In light of this new information, the patient is rapidly evaluated and receives IV tPA at 6pm, 3.75 hours after the new Last Known Well time of 2:15 pm. At the time of his initial evaluation, the care team was unable to determine if he was eligible due to the long interval from Last Known Well. Select "Care-team unable to determine eligibility" under Warnings for the 0-3 hour treatment window. . If there was no physician documentation describing this change in the time Last Known Well, do not infer that this was the cause of non-treatment in the 0-3 hour treatment window. Note the abstractor should also select “Yes” for “Documented contraindications or warnings for not initiating IV tPA in the 0-3 hour treatment window”

Taking an oral anticoagulan regardless of INR
Severe stroke (NIHSS > 25)
Notes for Abstraction:

Only select “Additional Warnings” if any of these reasons for no IV tPA are explicitly documented in the context of the 3-4.5 hour treatment window. (i.e. the physician documented “no IV tPA after 3 hours of symptom onset due to NIHSS= 27”, Select “NIHSS>25”.
Examples:

Patient 181a arrives at 1 hour and 50 minutes after Last Known Well, with an NIH stroke scale of 10 and he takes warfarin for atrial fibrillation. His blood pressure is 190/105 and he requires several doses of labetalol to control his blood pressure. By the time it is under control, it is 3hrs 10min after Last Known Well. His INR is 1.3. He does not receive IV tPA. The physician documents that he was not eligible for IV tPA when he arrived due to uncontrolled blood pressure and that the use of warfarin made him ineligible for treatment beyond 3 hours. Select “SBP > 185 or DBP > 110 mmHg despite treatment” under “Contraindications 0-3 hr window”, select “Increased risk of bleeding due to comorbid conditions” under “Warnings 3-4.5 hr window” and select “Any anticoagulant use prior to admission (even if INR < 1.7)” under “Additional Warnings 3-4.5 hr window”.
OPTIONAL: Hospital-related or Other Factors (0-3 hr and 3-4.5 hr treatment windows). Select all that apply

Select the reason(s) for not administering IV tPA that are present in the medical record which may or may not be documented but are apparent to the abstractor as reasons for non-treatment. This is the only section where it may be proper to infer reasons for non-treatment and is provided to assist in quality improvement activities. Selection of one or more of these reasons does NOT exclude patients from the denominator of the IV tPA measures. Failure to complete the work up within the 3 hour treatment window or failure to diagnose ischemic stroke are not valid reasons to not give thrombolytic therapy.

Delay in Patient Arrival
Delay in Stroke diagnosis
In-hospital Time Delay
No IV access
Other
Notes for Abstraction:

If "Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic?” is "No”, “Hospital-Related or Other Factors” can be selected. This is the ONLY section where it may be acceptable to infer reasons for non-treatment and is provided to assist in quality improvement activities.
If the diagnosis is unclear, select "Delay in Stroke diagnosis" under “Hospital-related or Other factors”. Note: The abstractor should also select "No" for “Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic?”
If there is a delay in getting the CT done or read, or a delay in patient evaluation, then select "In-hospital Time Delay".
If patients receive IA therapy in favor of IV t-PA and there is no evidence documented in the medical record that the patient/family was offered IV t-PA, then select "Other" under “Hospital related or Other Factors”. Note the abstractor should also select "No" for “Documented Contraindications or Warnings for not initiating IV thrombolytic?”
Do not select "Other" if you have already selected a Contraindication or Warning. The choices under “Hospital Related and Other Factor for non-treatment” including "Other" will NOT exclude patients from the denominator of the IV tPA measures.
Only use the "Other" field if there is no reason specified that can be accurately captured by the listed choices under Contraindications and Warnings. Be very certain that a reason does not logically fit into any of the listed categories before resorting to selecting “Other” and entering text in "Specify Other reason for non-treatment with IV thrombolytic". Review of the past data reveals that most of the reasons for not giving IV t-PA will fall into one of the above delineated categories.
Example:

Patient 182a arrives at the ED at 1hr 50min after Last Known Well. The hospital acute stroke team is consulted and every effort is made to treat him within 3 hours of symptom onset, but the bolus is not started until 3hr 10min after Last Known Well. Upon chart review, the abstractor identified that the patient arrived to the hospital at 09:15 but the stroke team was not consulted until 09:45. Select “In-hospital Time Delay” under Hospital related or Other Factors for the 0-3 hour treatment window. Because the patient did not receive IV tPA within the first 3 hours and there is no contraindication and/or warning documented for non-treatment in the 0-3 hour time window, DO NOT select any exclusion or relative exclusion criteria in the 0-3 hour treatment window.
OPTIONAL: Specify Other Reason for no- IV thrombolytic(0-3 and 3-4.5 hr treatment windows).

If "Other" is selected as the reason for non-treatment with IV thrombolytics under “Hospital Related or Other Factors”, specify the reason in the text box

REQUIRED (for patients that receive IV rt-PA beyond 60 minutes): If IV tPA was initiated greater than 60 minutes after hospital arrival, were Eligibility or Medical reason(s) documented as the cause for delay:

Yes: There is a documented eligibility or medical reason for not initiating IV tPA within 60 minutes of hospital arrival.
No: There are no specific documented eligibility or medical reasons in the medical record why tPA was not administered within 60 minutes of hospital arrival, or, a hospital-related or other reason was present which may or may not be documented but was apparent to the abstractor. This is the only section where it may be proper to infer reasons for non-treatment and is provided to assist in quality improvement activities.
Notes for Abstraction:

Reasons for delay in treatment with IV thrombolytic therapy must be documented by a physician/APN/PA or pharmacist.
Eligibility and/or medical reasons for delay in treatment must be mentioned in the context of IV thrombolytics. It is the intent that the abstractor will not make inference as to the eligibility or medical reasons for delay in treatment based upon the presence of certain patient clinical characteristics and conditions in the record, but will only abstract reasons that are specifically documented in the medical record as the reason for the delay beyond 60 minutes.
Example: If the physician documents that the patient has uncontrolled hypertension and because of this tPA cannot be administered until the patient’s blood pressure can be controlled with IV medications select the medical reason of “hypertension requiring aggressive control with IV medications.” Do not select this option simply because elevated blood pressure was described in the medical record.
If your hospital uses telemedicine in the assessment of stroke, and there is documentation in the medical record as to why the teleneurologist delayed treatment with IV tPA, this is acceptable as documentation to select the eligibility and or medical reason(s) specified by the teleneurologist. In this case, it is acceptable for the documentation in your hospital’s medical record to be done by a nurse.
It is permissible to abstract reasons for non-treatment from the medical record that are entered after the IV tPA treatment decision has occurred. This should be done only when the documentation is written by an appropriate provider who was involved in the IV tPA decision, but was unable to document it at the time. This documentation needs to be made prior to patient discharge. For example the neurologist who was called by telephone puts a note in the medical record the next day which documents the reasons for delay.
Select the specific reason(s) documented in the medical record for the delay in administration of IV tPA at this hospital.

Eligibility Reasons:

Social/Religious
Initial refusal
Care-team unable to determine eligibility
Medical Reasons:

Hypertension requiring aggressive control with IV medications
Further diagnostic evaluation to confirm stroke for patients with hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 50), seizures, or major metabolic disorders
Management of concomitant emergent/acute conditions such as cardiopulmonary arrest, respiratory failure (requiring intubation)
Investigational or experimental protocol for thrombolysis
Notes for Abstraction:

The following should help abstractors in classifying reasons:

Social/Religious means that the patient and/or family refused treatment due to their cultural or religious beliefs. As patients do have the right to change their treatment decisions, this choice should be selected if there is documentation that treatment with IV rt-PA was initially refused due to any social or religious reason. Example: Patient wishes to consult clergy prior to deciding whether or not he wishes to receive treatment. Clergy takes 30 minutes to arrive. After speaking with clergy, the patient decides to proceed with treatment with IV tPA. Treatment is provided once the patient consents (now 75 minutes after arrival).
Initial refusal should be selected if there is documentation that the patient and/or family initially refused treatment with IV rt-PA for any reason other than a social/religious reason.
For patients that cannot participate in shared decision making or provide consent, select "Initial Refusal" if there is documentation that there was a delay in treatment with IV rt-PA due to reasonable attempts to contact a proxy decision maker to obtain consent.
"Care-team unable to determine eligibility" means that the diagnosis of stroke was made but that eligibility for thrombolytic therapy could not be established or verified by the clinician. Examples may include:
The time of onset could not be clearly established at the time of initial patient assessment in the ED or time of Last Known Well is unknown
Timing of a recent procedure or surgery could not be definitively established.
A lack of an accurate history or concern about the presence of a preexisting medical condition raises concern about eligibility for IV thrombolytic therapy.
Patients who have experienced multiple episodes of transient neurologic dysfunction, or TIAs, which have fully resolved clinically, but imaging or other features of the history make it uncertain as to when the stroke actually started.
Hypertension requiring aggressive control with IV medications: Select this option if there is documentation that treatment with intravenous IV rt-PA was delayed because aggressive measures (such as continuous infusion or the use of two or more intravenous antihypertensive agents) were first needed to reduce BP to a treatable range.
Further diagnostic evaluation to confirm stroke for patients with hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 50), seizures, or major metabolic disorders that were potentially stroke mimics
Management of concomitant emergent/acute conditions such as cardiopulmonary arrest, respiratory failure (requiring intubation)
Investigational or experimental protocol for thrombolysis: Documentation indicates that administration of IV rt-PA was delayed due to an investigational or experimental thrombolytic protocol. If investigational or experimental protocol was used, there should be a signed IRB consent in the medical record.
If no documented eligibility or medical reason(s), Hospital Related or Other Reason(s):

If a hospital-related or other reason was present which may or may not be documented but was apparent to the abstractor select the appropriate reason. This is the only section where it may be proper to infer reasons for non-treatment and is provided to assist in quality improvement activities.

Data Element Name: First Pass of a Mechanical Reperfusion Device

Collected For: CSTK-07

Definition: First pass (i.e., deployment) of a mechanical reperfusion device to remove a clot occluding a cerebral artery at this hospital. A mechanical reperfusion device is also known as a clot retrieval device. Clot retrieval devices are designed to treat ischemic stroke by removal of the clot from the cerebral artery. Several brand names are used to identify clot retrieval devices which include, Merci, Penumbra, Trevo, and Solataire. For purposes of this data element, "pass" means mechanical deployment of a clot retrieval device.

MM = Minutes (00-59)
UTD = Unable to Determine

Notes for Abstraction:

If the date of the first pass is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD
Examples:
Documentation indicates the first pass date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the first pass date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Day, it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select UTD.
Patient expires on 02-12-20xx and documentation indicates the First Pass Date was 03-12-20xx. Other documentation in the medical record supports the date of death as being accurate. Since the First Pass Date is after the Discharge Date (death), it is outside of the parameters of care and the abstractor should select "UTD."
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for First Pass Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
For times that include "seconds", remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00.
If the First Pass Time is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD.
Example:
Documentation indicates the first pass time was 3300. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid time. Since the first pass time is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Hour, it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select UTD.
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid time as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for First Pass Time allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
The earliest time should be used regardless of how many vessels were treated or which ones were successful vs. unsuccessful.

OPTIONAL COMPREHENSIVE: Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Post-Treatment Reperfusion Grade

Modifed TICI grading system1

Grade 0: No Perfusion. No antegrade flow beyond the point of occlusion.
Grade 1: Penetration With Minimal Perfusion. The contrast material passes beyond the area of obstruction but fails to opacify the entire cerebral bed distal to the obstruction for the duration of the angiographic run.
Grade 2a: Partial tissue reperfusion in < 50% of the occluded artery.
Grade 2b: Partial reperfusion in ≥50% of the occluded artery territoy.
Grade 3: Essentially complete Perfusion. Antegrade flow into the bed distal to the obstruction occurs as promptly as into the obstruction and clearance of contrast material from the involved bed is as rapid as from an uninvolved other bed of the same vessel or the opposite cerebral artery.

REQUIRED FOR COMPREHENSIVE: Is there a documented TICI reperfusion gradepost-treatment?

Element definition from The Joint Commission Comprehensive Stroke Performance Measurement Implementation Guide

Data Element Name: Post-Treatment Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Reperfusion Grade

Collected For: CSTK-08

Definition: Documentation that the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) reperfusion grade was 2B (i.e., partial perfusion greater than or equal to 50% of vascular distribution of occulded artery) or higher post-treatment. The TICI scale is a tool used to grade the degree of perfusion obtained following recanalization of an arterial occlusion. Recanalization of an arterial occlusion increases reperfusion into distal segments of the artery and restores blood flow to brain tissue. Scores may range from 0 (no perfusion) to 3 (full perfusion with filling of all distal branches).

Suggested Data Collection Question: Is there a documented TICI reperfusion gradepost-treatment?

3 A TICI reperfusion grade was not done post-treatment, OR Unable to determine (UTD) from the medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

The TICI grade may be documented by the physician/APN/PA, or a nurse (RN), circulating nurse, or operating room technician designated to scribe during the procedure.
When multiple TICIs are documented because more than one vessel or branches of an artery are occluded, select the TICI grade associated with the site of primary vessel occlusion.
If unable to determine whether the TICI reflects reperfusion of the primary vessel, then select "UTD".

Indicate if there were any complications from the thrombolytic therapy.

Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage <36 hours
Life threatening, serious systemic hemorrhage <36 hours
Other serious complications
No serious complications
UTD
Notes for Abstraction:

Symptomatic brain hemorrhage is defined by a CT within 36 hours that shows intracranial hemorrhage AND physician's notes indicate clinical deterioration due to hemorrhage.
Life threatening, serious systemic hemorrhage is defined by bleeding within 36 hours of IV tPA and > 3 transfused units of blood within 7 days or discharge (whichever is earlier) AND physician note attributing bleeding problem as reason for transfusion
Other serious complications are those that require additional medical interventions or prolonged length of stay. Serious complications include those that are unexpected or out of proportion to the patient's expected course and that are documented as complications of reperfusion therapy. For example, rapid development of malignant edema, angioedema, or recurrent stroke. If complications do not require additional medical interventions or prolong the length of stay, select "No serious complications".
Select "UTD" if worsening stroke symptoms or in-hospital death without definitive evidence of a complication listed above (such as hemorrhage).
Example: Patient 190a received intravenous tPA in the ED on 07/01/20XX. The following day the patient developed a sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness. A head CT was performed which showed a large intracerebral hemorrhage. Select "Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage < 36 hours."

Symptomatic hemorrhage detected prior to patient transfer
Symptomatic hemorrhage detected only after patient transfer
Unable to determine
N/A
Notes for Abstraction:

If symptomatic brain or systemic hemorrhage was detected or strongly suspected prior to transfer, select "symptomatic hemorrhage detected prior to patient transfer". Select this option if the patient has hemodynamic instability suggesting systemic hemorrhage, or a deterioration in the neurologic exam suggesting intracerebral hemorrhage while still at the initial treating hospital, even if the testing which confirms the finding doesn't occur until after transfer.
If symptomatic brain or systemic hemorrhage is not detected or strongly suspected prior to transfer, and occurs only after the patient has left the initial treating facility, select "symptomatic hemorrhage detected only after patient transfer".
If it is not possible to obtain information from the hospital at which the patient received IV tPA prior to transfer (if you are the receiving hospital), or to which you transferred the patient after starting IV tPA (if you are the initial treating hospital), select "unable to determine". Note that the Federal Privacy Rule (HIPAA) does not restrict the communication of protected health information when performed for quality assurance purposes. To avoid interfering with an individual's access to quality health care or the efficient payment for such health care, the Privacy Rule permits a covered entity to use and disclose protected health information, with certain limits and protections, for treatment, payment, and health care operations activities. [These health care operations activities include] conducting quality assessment and improvement activities, population based activities relating to improving health or reducing health care costs, and case management and care coordination; Reviewing the competence or qualifications of health care professionals, evaluating provider and health plan performance, training health care and non-health care professionals, accreditation, certification, licensing, or credentialing activities [from The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191, enacted on August 21, 1996.]
Also select "Unable to determine" in case of patient death without confirmed hemorrhage.
If no tPA given, or if the patient is not transferred after IV-tPA (patient remains at your hospital), then this element is not applicable. Select N/A.
Examples:

Patient 200a received intravenous tPA in the ED at TMC on 07/01/04 at 11:00 and was transferred to GMC at 13:00. The following day at GMC the patient developed a sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness. A head CT was performed which showed a large intracerebral hemorrhage. Select "symptomatic hemorrhage detected only after patient transfer". If the symptoms began in the ambulance after leaving TMC, you would still select "symptomatic hemorrhage detected only after patient transfer".
Patient 200b received intravenous tPA in the ED at TMC on 07/01/04 at 11:00 and developed a sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness prior to transfer to GMC at 13:00. Upon arrival at GMC, a head CT was performed which showed a large intracerebral hemorrhage. Select "symptomatic hemorrhage detected prior to patient transfer".
Patient 200c received intravenous tPA in the ED at TMC on 07/01/04 at 11:00 and was transferred to GMC at 13:00. Despite a request by the staff at TMC to the Stroke Center director at GMC, no further information can be obtained about the patient after transfer. Select "unable to determine"

Notes for Abstraction:

The NIHSS score may be documented by the physician/APN/PA or nurse (RN).
Look for the highest NIHSS score documented in less than or equal to 36 hours following initiation of IA t-PA or MER therapy.
For purposes of this data element, score documentation between 0 and 42 is acceptable.
If only one NIHSS score is documented within the first 36 hours following initiation of IA t-PA or MER therapy and no other NIHSS score(s) are available for comparison, enter the value for that score.
If multiple scores are documented within the first 36 hours following initiation of IA t-PA or MER therapy, select the highest score.
EXAMPLES:
IA t-PA initiated at 1247 with first deployment of a mechanical reperfusion device at 1303. NIHSS Score is 10 at 1500 and 20 at 2300. Select NIHSS score of 20.
IA t-PA infusion initiated on 9/5/20XX at 0900. NIHSS score is 8 on 9/5/20XX at 2300, 10 on 9/6/20XX at 0100, and 8 on 9/6/20XX at 0300. Select NIHSS score 10.
MER initiated on 9/5/20XX at 0900. NIHSS score 3 on 9/6/20XX at 0900, 2 on 9/8/20XX at 0900, and 6 on 9/10/2012 at 0900. Select 3.
If no NIHSS score is documented within 36 hours following IA t-PA or MER therapy initiation, select UTD.
If unable to determine the highest score documented within 36 hours following IA t-PA or MER therapy initiation, select UTD.

Collected For: CSTK-05

Definition: The month, date, year and time for which a positive finding on brain imaging of parenchymal hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or intraventricular hemorrhage was documented. Early hemorrhagic transformation occurs in about one in ten patients with acute ischemic stroke, but only parenchymal hematoma predicts poor outcomes, according to the research.

Notes for Abstraction:

Use the date when a positive finding on brain imaging of parenchymal hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or intraventricular hemorrhage was first documented following IV or IA thrombolytic (t-PA) therapy, or mechanical endovascular reperfusion therapy initiation. If a discrepancy exists in date documentation from different sources, choose the earliest date. If there are two or more different positive brain image dates (either different brain images or corresponding with the same brain image), enter the earliest date.
If the date of positive brain image is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD.
Example:
Documentation indicates the positive brain image date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the positive brain image date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Day, it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select UTD.
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for Positive Brain Image Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
Use the time at which symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was first documented following IV or IA thrombolytic (t-PA) therapy, or mechanical endovascular reperfusion therapy initiation. If a discrepancy exists in time documentation from different sources, choose the earliest time. If there are two or more different symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage times (either different brain images or corresponding with the same brain image), enter the earliest time.
For times that include seconds, remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00
If the time of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD.

If reasons are not mentioned in the context of nimodipine treatment, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that nimodipine was not administered because of hypotension unless documentation explicitly states so.)
Reasons must be explicitly documented (e.g., BP 80/40 No nimodipine.)
Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a hold on nimodipine or discontinuation of nimodipine that occurs within the first 24 hours constitutes a clearly implied reason for not administering nimodipine treatment. A hold/discontinuation of all p.o. medications counts if nimodipine (i.e., Nimotop) was on order at the time of the notation.

Other In-Hospital Treatments and Screening


Patient NPO throughout the entire hospital stay? 
Was patient screened for dysphagia prior to any oral intake including water or medications? 
If yes, Dysphagia screening results: 
Treatment for Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia 
VTE Interventions
REQUIRED: Patient NPO throughout the entire hospital stay? 

Indicate if the patient was NPO (nothing by mouth), including food, water, or medications, for the entire hospital stay. This includes any medications delivered in the Emergency Room phase of care.

Yes: The patient was kept NPO during the entire hospitalization and was discharged, transferred, or deceased NPO.
No/ND: The patient was not kept NPO during entire hospital stay or the patient received food, water or medication by mouth during the hospitalization (even if there was an NPO order).
Notes for Abstraction:

Data abstractors should wait until either patient is taken off NPO or discharged prior to answering this question.
The delivery of food, fluid, or medication via a nasogastric tube, orogastric tube, or percutaneous gastrostomy tube should be independent of the assessment of NPO. "NPO except medications" is a commonly used order on patients who will be undergoing surgery or procedures in the near future to prevent the risk of peri-procedure complications. This order is used to limit the amount of material in the stomach prior to a procedure and is not relevant to the issue of dysphagia. "NPO except medications" is not an acceptable treatment order for patients who have not yet undergone dysphagia screening. Patient can be NPO and still receive delivery of food, fluid, or medication via a nasogastric tube (PNGT), orogastric tube (POGT), or percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PGT).
It is critical to review medication administration records from the ER to identify any oral medication received prior to the patient being made NPO or undergoing dysphagia screening, as this is a very common occurrence (for example "Aspirin 325mg POx1" prior to stroke team activation).
For inpatient stroke, assess NPO status from Date/Time of discovery of stroke symptoms? If the patient was made NPO prior to stroke symptom discovery and was kept NPO throughout the entire hospitalization select “Yes”.

Summary of Changes

REQUIRED: Was patient screened for dysphagia prior to any oral intake including water or medications?

Stroke patients should be screened for dysphagia before being given any oral intake including food, fluids, or medications.

Yes: There is documentation of screening for dysphagia prior to any oral intake.
No/ND: There is either documentation of oral intake prior to screening for dysphagia or there is no documentation of screening for dysphagia.
NC: There are documented reasons for not performing a screening for dysphagia prior to any oral intake.
Notes for Abstraction:

Documentation in the record should indicate that an assessment of the patient's ability to swallow was completed by a health care professional prior to oral intake of food, fluid, or medications. A screening test need not be a formal evaluation of swallowing by a speech and language pathologist, but should be a standardized method of swallowing assessment accepted by the institution.
A variety of methods may be employed to assess swallowing status. These methods may include but are not limited to:
Bedside swallow assessment
Simple water swallow test
Burke water swallow test
Bedside swallowing assessment
Simple standardized bedside swallowing assessment (SSA)
Barium swallow
Video fluoroscopy
Double contrast esophagoscopy
Radio nucleotide studies
Manometry
Endoscopy
Formal evaluation by speech language pathologist
If the patient was ONLY given sublingual (SL) medication specifically formulated for sublingual delivery (e.g., nitroglycerin) or traditionally given by sublingual route prior to dysphagia screen, this is not considered oral intake. These include medication formulations such as pills (e.g., lorazepam), orally disintegrating tablets (e.g., olanzipine) or wafers (e.g., clonazepam). If these sublingual medications are the only oral intake prior to dysphagia screen select “Yes”. If medications that are not traditionally given via the sublingual route are taken by the patient before dysphagia screening, then select the answer as “No/ND”.
The following are not acceptable as swallow screening:
Patient evaluation using the NIH/NIHSS (National Institute of Health/National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) is NOT considered dysphagia screening
Documentation of "Cranial nerves intact" is NOT considered dysphagia screening
Positive gag reflex noted
Reasons for not performing a dysphagia screen must be explicitly documented by a physician, advance practice nurse, or physician assistant. If reasons are not mentioned in the context of dysphagia screening, do not make inferences.
Acceptable reasons for not performing dysphagia screening include patient refused treatment, patients who are made CMO prior to receiving anything by mouth and patients with complete recovery of all symptoms and neurological deficits prior to hospital arrival (for these patients you may select the answer option of “NC” for this data element).
For inpatient stroke, assess dysphagia screen prior to oral intake from the date/time of discovery of stroke symptoms. If the patient arrives to the hospital with transient symptoms that resolve and was screened for dysphagia (prior to oral intake) but later in the hospital stay has new onset stroke symptoms and meets criteria to be entered as an inpatient stroke, a new dysphagia screen should be performed and dysphagia screen prior to oral intake should be assessed from the date/time stroke symptom discovery.
Examples:

Patient 210a is admitted to the in-patient unit from the ED as NPO. The ED physician notes document evidence of dysphagia and a formal swallowing evaluation is ordered and performed. Data entry will be to check "Yes".
Patient 210b is admitted with dysarthria and drooling. The ED physician notes evidence of dysphagia and the diet order reads NPO except meds. No formal swallowing evaluation is performed. Data entry is "No/ND".
Patient 210c is admitted to the hospital on 4/1/2012 for heart failure. The patient is given PO food and medications. On 4/3/2012 the nurse discovers that the patient has difficulty speaking and facial droop and calls the stroke team. The stroke PA performs an NIHSS and dysphagia screen. The patient did not receive any food, water or medications from the date/time of discovery of stroke symptoms to the date/time that the dysphagia screen was performed. Data entry is to Select “Yes”.
Patient 210d arrives to the hospital on 3/22/2012 with transient symptoms that resolve in the ED prior to admission. The patient had a dysphagia screen in the ED prior to oral intake. The patient is admitted to the stroke unit. Later that day nurse discovered that the patient developed new onset right sided-weakness. The nurse activates the stroke team and when the stroke physician arrives, the patient is eating dinner. The nurse did not do a repeat dysphagia screen. Data entry is to Select “No/ND.” Note, this patient would be entered as an inpatient stroke.

Notes for Abstraction:

Select "Pass" if there is documentation that the screen is passed, or that the patient successfully demonstrates safe swallowing on the initial bedside screening evaluation. Do not record the results of subsequent dysphagia screenings. Documentation might include evidence that oral intake of food or medication without modification of consistency or other swallowing related features is permitted unsupervised. Restrictions on type of diet such as amounts of calories, protein, etc are not relevant to this item.
Select "Fail" if there is documentation that the screen is failed, or that the patient did not demonstrate safe swallowing on dysphagia screening protocol. Restrictions in oral intake generally follow as a result of failure in screen.
Select "ND" if there was a screen performed but there is no documentation as to the results of the dysphagia screen.

OPTIONAL: Treatment for Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (Was the patient treated for pneumonia during this admission?)

Indicate if patient was treated for nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia after 48 hours of admission.

Yes: There is clinical mention of hospital-acquired pneumonia by the physician, and treatment with an antibiotic for pneumonia.
No: There is clinical mention of hospital-acquired pneumonia by the physician, but treatment with an antibiotic was not prescribed.
NC
Notes for Abstraction:

Documentation does not need to include the words “hospital acquired.” Classification of hospital acquired pneumonia can be accomplished by determining if there is clinical suspicion or mention of pneumonia in the medical record 48 or more hours after admission and then determining if pneumonia or clinical suspicion of pneumonia was documented on hospital admission. If there is no mention of pneumonia on admission, it is considered hospital acquired pneumonia.
The intent of this data element is to determine if there is clinical mention of pneumonia 48 or more hours after admission AND if subsequent treatment for pneumonia was administered. If there is clinical mention of pneumonia 48 or more hours after admission, but NO treatment with antibiotic, select “No”
Example: Patient 220a is admitted with stroke symptoms and started on an oral diet after passing a dysphagia screen. A chest X-ray from day 2 describes "pneumonia vs. atlectasis." This is mentioned in the physician notes but the decision is made to treat for congestive heart failure and wait for a fever before starting antibiotics. No antibiotics are subsequently given. Since a diagnosis of pneumonia was not made, select "NC".

REQUIRED: VTE Interventions

Please Note: As this is a data element that is shared by GWTG, TJC, and Coverdell the definition below comes directly from the Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality measures. This VTE interventions list only contains medications and devices that are FDA approved for VTE prophylaxis (items 1-8). If a patient is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for an indication other than prophylaxis (i.e. full dose IV heparin or an alternate anticoagulant such as dabigatran) and is not receiving any interventions on this list, select “A – None of the above or not documented or unable to determine from medical record documentation” here and then select the appropriate medication from the “Other Therapeutic Anticoagulation” list. If a patient is receiving Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and is not receiving any other medication on this list, select 8-Oral factor Xa inhibitor here and also select Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) under the “Other Therapeutic Anticoagulation” list. If a patient is receiving Apixaban (Eliquis) and is not receiving any other medication on this list, select 8-Oral factor Xa inhibitor here and also select Apixaban (Eliquis) under the “Other Therapeutic Anticoagulation” list. If a patient is receiving treatment with an intervention on this VTE interventions list and is also receiving an alternate anticoagulant, just select the appropriate interventions from the “VTE Interventions” list.

Element definition from Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures

The type of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis documented in the medical record:

1- Low dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH)
2- Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
3- Intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC)
5- Factor Xa Inhibitor
6- Warfarin
7- Venous foot pumps (VFP)
8- Oral Factor Xa Inhibitor
A- None of the above or not documented or unable to determine from medical records documentation
Notes for Abstraction:

No value should be selected more than once. If a value of "A" is selected, no other selection should be recorded. 
Example:
Lovenox is ordered and substituted with dalteparin. Only abstract value "2" once, as both are LMWH.
Application of mechanical prophylaxis may be documented by any personnel.
Example:
Nursing assistant documentation of IPC application during the allowable timeframe is acceptable.
Selection of allowable values 1-8 includes any prophylaxis that was initially administered in the allowable time frame.
Example:
If a patient was admitted on 12/8/20xx and had IPCs applied at 13:00 on 12/09/20xx and LMWH was administered at 22:00 on 12/8/20xx, select values “2” and “3”.
Only select prophylaxis if there is documentation that it was administered. Documentation in the physician progress notes under assessment/Plan: “DVT prophylaxis – IPC” is not enough to select Value “3.”
If one pharmacological medication is ordered and another medication is substituted (such as per pharmacy formulary substitution or protocol), abstract the medication administered.
Note: No copy of the formulary or protocol is required in the medical record.
Example:
Lovenox is ordered, but not received and is substituted with fondaparinux sodium, which is received by the patient. Abstract fondaparinux sodium as Value “5” for VTE Prophylaxis and abstract the date it was administered for VTE Prophylaxis Date.
Abstract ALL VTE prophylaxis(s) that was administered the day of or the day after hospital admission. If no VTE prophylaxis was administered during this timeframe, select "A."
VTE Prophylaxis administered in the ED or Observation prior to the hospital admission order is not sufficient.

REQUIRED: What date was the VTE prophylaxis administered?

Please Note: As this is a data element that is shared by GWTG, TJC, and Coverdell the definition below comes directly from the Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures.
Element definition from Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures

The day, month and year that VTE prophylaxis (mechanical and/or pharmacologic) was administered after hospital admission.

MM = Month (1-12)
DD = Day (01-31)
YYYY = Year (20xx)
UTD = Unable to Determine
Notes for Abstraction:

STK

The earliest date associated with a form of prophylaxis should be entered.
Example:
If the patient was admitted on 12-08-20xx and IPCs were applied at 13:00 on 12-08-20xx and LMWH was administered at 02:00 on 12-09-20xx, record the 12-08-20xx date.
STK or VTE

The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at “face value”). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select “UTD”.
Example:
Documentation indicates the VTE Prophylaxis Date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the VTE Prophylaxis Date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for “Day,” it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select “UTD”.
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the CMS Clinical Warehouse and the Joint Commission’s Data Warehouse. Use of “UTD” for VTE Prophylaxis Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouses.”

REQUIRED FOR TJC if VTE Interventions is 4 or A: Is there physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation why VTE prophylaxis was not administered at hospital admission?

Element definition from Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures

Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation why mechanical AND pharmacological VTE prophylaxis was not administered at hospital admission.

Explicit documentation of a contraindication to BOTH mechanical prophylaxis AND pharmacological prophylaxis is needed.
Yes: there is physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation why VTE prophylaxis was not administered at hospital admission.  
No: there is no physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation why VTE prophylaxis was not administered at hospital admission or unable to determine from medical record documentation.  
Notes for Abstraction:

If a patient received prophylaxis as per the data element VTE Prophylaxis, select "No."
To select "Yes" for this data element, documentation must be dated from arrival to the day after hospital admission or surgery end date. Documentation written after arrival but prior to admission is acceptable.
Reasons for not prescribing mechanical and pharmacological VTE prophylaxis must be documented by a physician/APN/PA or pharmacist.
Exceptions:
Patient/family refusal may be documented by a nurse, but should be documented within the same time frame as the reason for no VTE prophylaxis. Patient/family refusal of any form of prophylaxis is acceptable.
Example:
Patient refused heparin, select “Yes.”
For patients on anticoagulants:
For patients on continuous IV heparin therapy the day of or day after hospital admission, select “Yes.”
If warfarin is listed as a home or current medication, select “Yes” regardless of other documentation.
For patients receiving anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation or for other conditions (e.g. angioplasty), with anticoagulation administered on the day of or the day after hospital admission, select “Yes.”
If reasons are not mentioned in the context of VTE prophylaxis, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that VTE Prophylaxis was not administered because of a bleeding disorder unless documentation explicitly states so).
Example:
Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of bleeding risk, review the chart for documentation about reasons for no mechanical AND reasons for no pharmacological VTE prophylaxis.
Exception:
Documentation within the timeframe specified that the patient is a bilateral lower extremity amputee is an acceptable reason for no mechanical prophylaxis.

Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation that the patient is ambulating without mention of VTE prophylaxis is insufficient. Do not infer that VTE prophylaxis is not needed unless explicitly documented.
Examples:
There is documentation of “No VTE Prophylaxis, patient ambulating,” select “Yes.”
There is documentation of “Patient low risk for VTE, ambulating,” select “Yes.”
For patients with a reason for no pharmacologic or no mechanical prophylaxis and an order for ANY prophylaxis that was NOT administered without a reason, select “No.”
Example:
Patient has documentation of an order for IPCs and no documentation that IPCs were applied, select “No.
If two physicians/APN/PA or pharmacists document conflicting or questionable risk/needs for prophylaxis, select “No.”
If a risk assessment is used, and notes anything other than low risk (e.g. intermediate risk, moderate risk, or high risk), additional documentation must be present to answer “Yes.” Explicit documentation of a contraindication to mechanical AND contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis must be addressed.
If there is physician documentation of “bleeding, no pharmacologic prophylaxis” the chart must be reviewed for documentation about a reason for no mechanical prophylaxis in order to select “Yes.”
Examples:
Bleeding, no pharmacologic prophylaxis, no mechanical prophylaxis.
Active GI bleed – low molecular weight heparin contraindicated, no mechanical prophylaxis needed.
"No VTE Prophylaxis", "No VTE Prophylaxis needed" [no reason given].
If Comfort Measures Only (CMO) was documented after the day after arrival (Day 1) but by the day after hospital admission, select “Yes.”
Example:
Patient arrives in the ED on 06/01/20xx but is in observation until admission to the hospital on 06/03/20xx. If CMO is documented by 06/04/20xx, select “Yes.”
Documentation that the patient is adequately anticoagulated or already anticoagulated on warfarin, select “Yes.”
Examples:
Patient is already anticoagulated, taking Coumadin at home prior to admission.
INR therapeutic and adequately anticoagulated at this time.
Documentation synonymous with “abruptly reversed anticoagulation for major bleeding,” select “Yes.”
Examples:
INR reversal for major bleeding.
Reverse anticoagulation for intracranial hemorrhage.
Documentation of administration of IV tPA is NOT a stand-alone reason for no VTE prophylaxis.

Select “VTE Interventions = Intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC)”. Since this patient is already on IPC, the “Other Therapeutic Anticoagulation” section will be grayed out and you will not need to enter that the patient received IV Heparin in this section.

 
Summary of Changes

OPTIONAL: Was DVT or PE documented? (Was evidence of DVT or PE (pulmonary embolus) documented?)

Indicate if evidence of DVT or PE was documented in the medical record. This question refers to the in-hospital development of DVT or PE. Pre-existing DVT or PE prior to admission should not be counted.

Yes
No/ND
The documentation of DVT or PE must be confirmed by ultrasound, venous imaging or appropriate diagnostic modality. [The Joint Commission defines this as objectively confirmed DVT based on duplex ultrasound, contrast venography, CT with contrast or CT venogram, MR imaging or MR venography]. Insure that the report clearly indicates that a deep vein, and not a superficial vein, is involved.

Examples:

Patient 250a was prescribed DVT prophylaxis on admission to hospital for ischemic stroke. On day 4 of admission the patient had a tender calf, ultrasound revealed a DVT of the left calf. Answer would be "Yes".
Patient 250b was prescribed DVT prophylaxis on admission to hospital for ischemic stroke. On day 4 of admission the patient had a tender calf, ultrasound was negative for DVT. Answer would be "No/ND".
Patient 250c was prescribed DVT prophylaxis on admission to hospital for ischemic stroke. On the day of admission, the patient complained of a tender calf for the previous 3 days. Ultrasound revealed a DVT of the left calf. Answer would be "No/ND".
Patient 250d was prescribed DVT prophylaxis on admission to hospital for ischemic stroke. There is no documentation about imaging studies performed to identify DVT. Answer would be "No/ND".

REQUIRED: Was antithrombotic therapy administered by the end of hospital day 2?

Note for Stroke Core Measure/TJC users: This field autopopulates "Was antithrombotic therapy administered by the end of hospital day 2?" in the Core Measure tab. Verify that the antithrombotic medication is acceptable for TJC/CMS stroke core measures by checking Appendix C Table 8.2 in the most current specifications manual. If the medication administered does not appear in Table 8.2, you must change the autopopulated response in the Core Measure Tab to "Was antithrombotic therapy administered by the end of hospital day 2?" to "No" in order to be compliant with TJC/CMS standards.

Is there documentation that the patient received antithrombotic therapy by the end of hospital day two?

Yes: Antithrombotic therapy was administered by the end of hospital day 2.
No/ND: Antithrombotic therapy was not administered by the end of hospital day 2, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.
NC: There is documentation in the medical record of a reason for not administering antithrombotic therapy by end of hospital day 2.
Notes for Abstraction:

Refer to Table 4 and Table 5 for acceptable antithrombotic therapy. Antithrombotics include both anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs.
To compute end of Hospital Day two, count the day of arrival at this hospital as day one. If antithrombotic therapy was administered by 11:59 PM of hospital day two, answer “Yes” for this data element.
Examples:
Patient arrives in ED on Monday 05:00, antithrombotic therapy must be initiated before 23:59 on Tuesday;
Patient arrives at 23:30 on Monday antithrombotic therapy must be initiated by 23:59 on Tuesday.
For antithrombotic therapy administered in the Emergency Department/observation area prior to the end of hospital day 2, select “Yes”.
Antithrombotic therapy administration information must demonstrate actual administration of the medication.
Example: Do not use physician orders as they do not demonstrate administration of the antithrombotic therapy (in the ED this may be used if signed/initialed by a nurse).
When antithrombotic is noted as a “home” or “current” medication or documentation indicates that it was received prior to hospital arrival only, select “No”.
Documentation of antithrombotic administration must be found within the timeframe of arrival to the end of hospital day 2. It is not necessary to review documentation outside of this timeframe to answer this data element.
Emergency medical system (EMS) or ambulance documentation as well as documentation dated/timed prior to hospital arrival or after hospital day 2 should be excluded.
Reasons for not prescribing antithrombotic medication must be documented by a physician, advance practice nurse or physician assistant (with one exception: Patient/family refusal does not have to be documented by a physician/APN/PA or pharmacist but it must be documented in the timeframe of arrival to the end of hospital day 2.).
If reasons are not mentioned in the context of antithrombotics, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that antithrombotic medication is not being prescribed because of a bleeding disorder unless documentation explicitly states so).
Documentation for allowable value “NC” must be found within the timeframe of arrival to the end of hospital day 2. It is not necessary to review documentation outside of this timeframe to answer this data element.
An allergy or adverse reaction to one type of antithrombotic would NOT be a reason for not administering all antithrombotics. Another medication can be ordered.
Orders to hold antithrombotic therapy without a documented reason is NOT acceptable to select “NC”.
Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a hold on an antithrombotic medication or discontinuation of an antithrombotic medication that occurs the day of or day after hospital arrival constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not administering antithrombotic therapy by end of hospital day 2. A hold/discontinuation of all p.o. medications counts if an antithrombotic was on order at the time of the notation.
For patients on warfarin therapy prior to hospital arrival, but placed on hold the day of or after arrival due to “high INR”, select “Yes”.
If antithrombotic held for 24 hours due to status post IV tPA, select “NC”.
Acceptable reasons for not giving antithrombotic medication by the end of the 2nd hospital day include:
Allergy to or complication related to antithrombotic
Aortic dissection
Bleeding disorder
Brain/CNS cancer
CVA, hemorrhagic
Extensive/metastatic CA
Hemorrhage, any type
Intracranial surgery/biopsy
Patient/family refusal
Peptic ulcer
Planned surgery within 7 days following discharge
Risk of bleeding or discontinued due to bleeding
Serious side effect to medication
Unrepaired intracranial aneurysm
Terminal Illness
Other documented by physician/APN/PA or pharmacist
For inpatient stroke, to compute end of Hospital Day two, count the day of stroke symptom discovery as day one. If antithrombotic therapy was administered by 11:59 PM of the day after stroke symptom discovery, answer “Yes” for this data element. If the patient was receiving antithrombotic therapy prior to date/time stroke discovery you still need to assess whether the patient was receiving antithrombotic therapy by the second hospital day after the discovery of stroke symptoms.
Please note: Anticoagulants at doses (low dose) designed to prevent deep vein thrombosis are insufficient as antithrombotic therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA. Conversely, antiplatelet agents at doses to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA are insufficient therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis. However, anticoagulants at full therapeutic doses (full dose LMW heparin, Unfractionated heparin IV, or conventional full dose warfarin) are considered acceptable treatment options for both DVT prophylaxis and antithrombotic medication.

DVT prevention doses may include:
dalteparin (Fragmin): 2500 or 5000 units SQ every day
enoxaparin (Lovenox): 30-40 mg SQ every day or 2 times a day
fondaparinux (Arixtra): 2.5 mg SQ every day
Heparin: 5000 units SQ every 8-12 hrs
rivaroxaban (Xarelto) Oral: 10 mg every day for prevention of DVT after hip surgery
Therapeutic doses, that may prevent DVT and also be effective as therapeutic anticoagulation to prevent stroke, may include:
apixaban (Eliquis): 5mg twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily in patients with two or more of the following: age >/= 80 years, weight </= 60kg, or serum creatinine >/= 1.5mg/dL)
argatroban at any dose IV infusion
dabigatran (Pradaxa): 150 mg 2 times a day (75 mg 2 times a day in patients with renal failure)
dalteparin (Fragmin) : 100 mg/kg SQ every 12hrs
desirudin (Iprivask): 15 mg every 12 hours
enoxaparin (Lovenox): 1 mg/kg SQ 2 times a day
fondaparinux (Arixtra): 5-10 mg SQ every day
Heparin: continuous IV infusion titrated to elevated PTT outside the normal range. Typical ranges could include PTT 50-70 or 60-84; however, IV heparin is not of proven benefit for acute ischemic stroke or secondary prevention of stroke.
lepirudin (Refludan) at any dose IV infusion
rivaroxaban (Xarelto) Oral: 20 mg every day (15 mg every day in patients with renal failure)
These doses are provided to aid chart abstraction and not as an endorsement of any of the specific medicines for treatment or prevention of stroke. In many cases these medicines are not approved by the FDA for treatment or prevention of stroke, but could reasonably be used off-label for that purpose.
Example: Patient 260a arrives at ED on Monday at 05:00 with an ischemic stroke. Because beds are full, patient waits in ED holding bed, and patient is not delivered to the stroke unit until 15:00 on Tuesday. Hospital day 1 is Monday (day of arrival at hospital), hospital day 2 is Tuesday. Patient should receive antithrombotic therapy by 23:59 on Tuesday in order to answer “Yes”.

Notes for Abstraction:
If the date IA t-PA or MER was initiated is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at "face value"). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD. 
Example: 
Documentation indicates the MER initiation date as 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the MER initiation date is outside of the range listed in the allowable Values for Day, it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select UTD. 
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commission's Data Warehouse. Use of "UTD" for IA t-PA or Mer Initiation Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.

A mechanical reperfusion device is also known as a clot retrieval device. Clot retrieval devices are designed to treat ischemic stroke by removal of the clot from the cerebral artery. Several brand names are used to identify clot retrieval devices which include, Merci, Penumbra, Trevo, and Solataire. For purposes of this data element, “pass” means mechanical deployment of a clot retrieval device.

When converting Midnight or 24:00 to 00:00, do not forget to change the First Radiographic Image Date.

Notes for Abstraction:

The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD 
Examples:
Documentation indicates the first pass date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the first pass date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for “Day,” it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select “UTD”.
Patient expires on 02-12-20xx and documentation indicates the First Pass Date was 03-12-20xx. Other documentation in the medical record supports the date of death as being accurate. Since the First Pass Date is after the Discharge Date (death), it is outside of the parameters of care and the abstractor should select “UTD.”
For times that include “"seconds”", remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00.
If the First Pass Time is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select “UTD”.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at “face value”). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select “UTD”.

^^Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Post-Treatment Reperfusion Grade
Data Element Name:

TICI Reperfusion Grade

Collected For:

EVT Measure Set

Definition:

 

 

 

 

Rationale:

The technical goal of the thrombectomy procedure should be a TICI grade 2b/3 angiographic result to maximize the probability of a good functional clinical outcome (Class I; Level of Evidence A).

The Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Reperfusion Grade is used to measure cerebral reperfusion. Results with this scoring system range between zero and three: 0 (no perfusion); 1 (perfusion past the initial occlusion, but no distal branch filling); 2 (perfusion with incomplete or slow distal branch filling); and, 3 (full perfusion with filling of all distal branches). Reperfusion past the target arterial occlusion and into the distal arterial bed and terminal branches, in conjunction with recanalization of the target arterial occlusion, demonstrates flow restoration or revascularization.

Endovascular therapy (EVT) is now the standard of care for treatment of acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion (LVO). In 2015, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association published a focused update to the 2013 Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke regarding endovascular treatment (Powers WJ, et. al., 2015). Endovascular therapy with a stent retriever is recommended for eligible patients. To ensure benefit, reperfusion to TICI 2B/3 should be achieved as early as possible and within 6 hours of stroke onset. As with IV t-PA, reduced time from symptom onset to reperfusion with EVT is highly associated with better clinical outcomes.

Data Collection Question:

Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Post-Treatment Reperfusion Grade

Format:

Length: 1

Type: Single-select

Occurs: 1

Allowable Values:

Modified TICI grading system1

· Grade 0: No Perfusion. No antegrade flow beyond the point of occlusion.

· Grade 1: Penetration with Minimal Perfusion. The contrast material passes beyond the area of obstruction but fails to opacify the entire cerebral bed distal to the obstruction for the duration of the angiographic run.

· Grade 2a: Partial tissue reperfusion in < 50% of the occluded artery.

· Grade 2b: Partial reperfusion in ≥50% of the occluded artery territory.

· Grade 3: Essentially complete Perfusion. Antegrade flow into the bed distal to the obstruction occurs as promptly as into the obstruction and clearance of contrast material from the involved bed is as rapid as from an uninvolved other bed of the same vessel or the opposite cerebral artery.

Notes for Abstraction:

If a TICI reperfusion grade was not done post treatment or cannot be determined from medical record documentation, select “ND.”
TICI grade must be documented by a Physician/APN/PA.

^Is there a documented TICI reperfusion grade post-treatment?
Data Element Name:

Post-Treatment Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Reperfusion Grade

Collected For:

CSTK-08, CSTK-11, CSTK-12,

Definition:

Documentation that the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) reperfusion grade was 2B (i.e., partial perfusion greater than or equal to 50% of vascular distribution of occluded artery) or higher post-treatment. The TICI scale is a tool used to grade the degree of perfusion obtained following recanalization of an arterial occlusion.

Recanalization of an arterial occlusion increases reperfusion into distal segments of the artery and restores blood flow to brain tissue. Scores may range from 0 (no perfusion) to 3 (full perfusion with filling of all distal branches).

2 = A TICI reperfusion grade less than (<) 2B was documented post-treatment.

3 = A TICI reperfusion grade was not done post-treatment, OR Unable to determine (UTD) from the medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

· The TICI grade may be documented by the physician/APN/PA, or a nurse (RN), circulating nurse, operating room technician designated to scribe during the procedure.

· When multiple TICIs are documented because more than one vessel or branches of an artery are occluded, select the TICI grade associated with the site of primary vessel occlusion.

· If unable to determine whether the TICI reflects reperfusion of the primary vessel, then select "UTD".

Use the date a TICI 2B/3 was first documented. If a discrepancy exists in date documentation from different sources, choose the earliest date. If multiple dates are documented during the procedure, use the earliest date
The procedure end date may be used if an earlier date is not documented during the procedure.
If the date a TICI 2B/3 was first documented is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select “UTD”.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at “face value”). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select “UTD”.
Example:
Documentation indicates the Post-Treatment Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Reperfusion Grade Date was 03-*42*-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the Post-Treatment Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Reperfusion Grade Date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for “Day,” it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select “UTD”.
Note:
Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commission’s Data Warehouse. Use of “UTD” for Post-Treatment Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Reperfusion Grade Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.

Notes for Abstraction:

·         Use the date when a positive finding on brain imaging of parenchymal hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or intraventricular hemorrhage was first documented following IV or IA thrombolytic (t-PA) therapy, or mechanical endovascular reperfusion therapy initiation. If a discrepancy exists in date documentation from different sources, choose the earliest date. If there are two or more different positive brain image dates (either different brain images or corresponding with the same brain image), enter the earliest date.

·         If the date of positive brain image is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select Unknown.


Example:
Documentation indicates the positive brain image date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the positive brain image date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Day, it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select Unknown. Time must be recorded in military time format. Except for Midnight and Noon:

·         If the time is in the a.m., conversion is not required

·         Use the time at which symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was first documented following IV or IA thrombolytic (t-PA) therapy, or mechanical endovascular reperfusion therapy initiation. If a discrepancy exists in time documentation from different sources, choose the earliest time. If there are two or more different symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage times (either different brain images or corresponding with the same brain image), enter the earliest time.

·         For times that include “seconds”, remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00

·         If the time of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select Unknown.

·         The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select Unknown.

·         Example:
Documentation indicates primary brain image time was 3300. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid time. Since primary brain image time is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for hour. it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select Unknown.

Notes for Abstraction:

·         Use the date at which administration of nimodipine was first documented. If a discrepancy exists in date documentation from different sources, choose the earliest date. If there are two or more different nimodipine administration dates (either different nimodipine episodes or corresponding with the same episode), enter the earliest date.

·         If the date nimodipine treatment was administered is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select Unknown.

·         The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select Unknown.
Example:
Documentation indicates the nimodipine administration date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the nimodipine administration date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Day, it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select UTD.

·         Use the time at which initiation of nimodipine administration was first documented. If a discrepancy exists in time documentation from different sources, choose the earliest time. If there are two or more different nimodipine administration times (either different nimodipine episodes or corresponding with the same episode), enter the earliest time.

·         For times that include seconds, remove the seconds and record the time as is. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00

·         Nimodipine administration time refers to the time that the first dose of nimodipine was administered.

·         Do not use physician orders as they do not demonstrate administration of nimodipine treatment (in the ED this may be used if signed/initialed by a nurse).

·         If the time of nimodipine administration is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select Unknown.

·         The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select Unknown.

·         Example:
Documentation indicates the nimodipine administration time was 3300. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid time. Since the nimodipine administration time is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Hour, it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select Unknown.

o    Reasons must be explicitly documented (e.g., BP 80/40 No nimodipine.)

o    Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a hold on nimodipine or discontinuation of nimodipine that occurs within the first 24 hours of hospital arrival constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not administering nimodipine treatment. A hold/discontinuation of all P.O. medications counts if nimodipine (i.e., Nimotop, Nymalize) was on order at the time of the notation. 
EXCEPTION:
Documentation of a conditional hold or discontinuation of nimodipine (e.g., Hold nimodipine if SBP < 100 mm/Hg, Stop nimodipine if AST > 50 IU/L.

Patients with cerebellar hemorrhage who are deteriorating neurologically or who have brainstem compression and/or hydrocephalus from ventricular

obstruction should undergo surgical removal of the hemorrhage as soon as possible (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Initial treatment of these patients with

ventricular drainage rather than surgical evacuation

is not recommended (Class III; Level of Evidence C). (Unchanged from the previous guideline)

 

For most patients with supratentorial ICH, the usefulness of surgery is not well established (Class IIb; Level of Evidence A).

Specific exceptions and potential subgroup considerations are outlined below in recommendations

The effectiveness of minimally invasive clot evacuation with stereotactic or endoscopic aspiration with or without thrombolytic usage is uncertain (Class IIb; Level of Evidence B). (Revised from the previous guideline)

Lipids NC: Only select if the patient refuses to have labs drawn or there is documentation that the patient is comfort measures only within 48 hours of arrival.
A1C (%)
A1C ND: A1C value is not measured or is measured but the value is not available.
REQUIRED FOR COMPREHENSIVE & PATIENTS THAT RECEIVE IV tPA: What is the first blood glucose value obtained prior to or after hospital arrival?
Blood Glucose ND: Blood glucose is not measured or is measured but the value is not available.
Blood Glucose Too High or Too Low: If the glucometer reading states “Low” or “High” as opposed to a numeric value, select the appropriate checkbox of either “Too Low” or “Too High.”
Notes for Abstraction:

For the lipid measurements, enter the highest value measured within the first 48 hours after arrival or within 30 days prior to hospital arrival. Fasting and non-fasting LDL-c values are both acceptable.(1)
If the first lipid values available are measured greater than 48 hours after arrival, select “Lipids: ND”. Do not enter values measured after 48 hours.
For patients whose triglycerides are >400 mg/dL, enter the values for total cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides, BUT leave the LDL value blank. EXCEPTION: If your hospital has the capability to directly measure LDL levels and this is available to you, enter that value.
If triglycerides are < 400 mg/dL, LDL can be calculated from the following formula:
LDL = Total Cholesterol - (HDL + (Triglycerides / 5)). However, if triglycerides are >= 400 mg/dL, this formula cannot be used to compute LDL.
For the A1C measurement, enter the first value measured or if available within 30 days in the outpatient record for diabetics.
For Blood Glucose (mg/dL), enter the first measurement upon arrival to your hospital. If supplemental glucose was given prior to hospital arrival, enter the blood glucose level obtained in the pre-hospital setting prior to the provision of glucose if that level is available. Blood Glucose is a required data element for patients that receive IV tPA.
If an outpatient value is available within 30 days for lipids and another lipid panel is measured in the hospital within 48 hours of arrival enter the more recent values.
For inpatient strokes:
Only enter lipids measured within 48 hours of actual arrival or if available as a fasting sample within 30 days in the outpatient record.
A1C and blood glucose should be the first values measured upon arrival to your hospital.
Example: Patient 270a arrived in your ED on 7/25/2011. A non-fasting sample for lipid testing was drawn in the ED on arrival. A second fasting sample was taken on 7/29/2011. Enter the values obtained from the ED as the non fasting sample is acceptable and the second sample was drawn greater than 48 hours after arrival.

Notes for Abstraction:

Because this data element is critical in determining the population for all measures, the abstractor should NOT assume that the claim information for the discharge date is correct. If the abstractor determines through chart review that the claim date is incorrect, she/he should correct and override the downloaded value. If the abstractor is unable to determine the correct discharge date through chart review, she/he should default to the claim discharge date.
The discharge date is the day that the patient is discharged from your institution's acute care unit OR the date of the patient's expiration OR the date of the patient's discharge OR date patient left against medical advice (AMA) OR date of transfer to, a rehabilitating, skilled nursing, or hospice unit in your institution OR transfer to an acute in-patient unit outside of your own institution, even if that hospital is affiliated with your own OR expired. If the patient is never admitted to your facility (i.e. you answered the data element of “Not Admitted” as “Yes, Not Admitted” enter the date of discharge from the ED or observation unit.”

OPTIONAL: Get With The Guidelines® Ischemic Stroke-Only Estimated Mortality Rate

Calculation of predicted probability of in-hospital death based on stroke patient risk factors present on admission. This reported percentage represents the individual patient's predicted risk for in-hospital mortality. It is calculated based on the following risk factors at the time of hospital presentation: age, gender, arrival mode, medical history, date and time of arrival, and NIHSS (if present). This predicted probability formula was derived and validated using the Get With The Guidelines®-Stroke database using a model that is applicable only to Ischemic stroke patients. This risk prediction is intended to enhance not replace clinical assessment and physician judgment. If too many of the necessary variables are missing, the mortality rate cannot be calculated for the patient.

Any of the following cases will exclude the calculation of a risk score:

Patient was transferred from another hospital
Patient was transferred from your ED to another acute care hospital

Modified Rankin Scale at discharge 
Required field for GWTG - Stroke

Definition: Documentation in the medical record of a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) completed at time of discharge. The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a 6- point disability scale with possible scores ranging from 0 to 5. A separate category of 6 is usually added for patients who expire.

Data Collection Question: Was a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) performed at discharge?

Format: Single-select field

>Allowable Values:

Yes: A Modified Rankin Scale was performed at discharge
No/ND: A Modified Rankin Scale was not performed or was performed but the total score is not available.
Notes for Abstraction:

This mRS assessment is intended to measure disability at the time of discharge. If there is more than 1 measured, use the mRS measured closest to hospital discharge. Ideally the mRS will be measured at discharge.
If a mRS measurement has not been documented in the medical record, but sufficient information is available from the physical therapy (PT) notes, occupational therapy (OT) notes, and/or other sources to allow a mRS to be assigned retrospectively assigned mRS score may be entered into the case report form. Select "Yes" to this data element and enter the findings under Total Score.
If the mRS is not measured or documented and a mRS cannot be assigned retrospectively, then select "No/ND."
It is highly recommended that the mRS be measured by certified individuals.
Two formal scoring methods for the mRS are the Simplified Questionnaire (SQ) and the Rankin Focused Assessment (RFA).
The Simplified Questionnaire may not be the most appropriate for use in the pre-discharge setting.
The more detailed Rankin Focused Assessment may be more appropriate for use at post-discharge visits, but also may be helpful to use selectively for cases in which pre-discharge scoring based on the SQ is uncertain.

Notes for Abstraction:

Able to ambulate independently (no help from another person) w/or w/o device: Patient ambulating without assistance (no help from another person) with or without a device. This means patient is able to ambulate without help from another person. The use of a device, such as a cane, still meets this definition. Patient ambulating to and from the bathroom unassisted. Even though actual ambulation is not documented in the medical record, privileges to walk to and from the bathroom and evidence of the patient getting out of bed unassisted are considered to meet the definition of ambulation.
With assistance (from person): Patient ambulating with assistance of another person.
Unable to ambulate: Patient is on bedrest. Patient is only getting out of bed to the bedside commode (or up in chair) and is primarily in the bed (or immobile) at discharge
ND: If it is unable to determine from documentation.
Examples: Patient 310a is ambulating with assistance from nursing. There is documented evidence of the patient walking around the unit with assistance from his nurses. Choose "With assistance (from person)."

General Instructions for these sections:

If the discharge destination is expired or "left against medical advice" or Hospice, these fields will be pre-selected as NC or "None - contraindicated". If the patient did not receive a medication at discharge due to a contraindication, or if the treatment was not indicated (i.e., not applicable) for the patient in question, or if the patient refused, select NC or "None - contraindicated".
If a patient is discharged with instructions that a medication will be started at a follow-up visit, select No.
If the reason for non-treatment specifically documents a contraindication, select NC or "None - contraindicated".
            Examples:

Patient 320a was admitted to your facility with an ischemic stroke. On discharge he was given a prescription for Coumadin and it is documented in the record that he is not to start the medication for one week due to an increased risk of bleeding. Data entry for antithrombotic medication at discharge would be None-contraindicated or NC.
Patient 320b was admitted to your facility with an ischemic stroke. His LDL was found to be 130. The patient had some issues with elevated LFTs and the physician writes in the medical record that he will start the patient on a cholesterol reducing medication in a follow up appointment after discharge given the patients LFTs. Data entry for cholesterol reducing medication at discharge would be None-contraindicated or NC.

In determining whether antithrombotic therapy was prescribed at discharge, it is not uncommon to see conflicting documentation amongst different medical record sources. For example, the discharge summary may list an antithrombotic that is not included in any of the other discharge medication sources (e.g., discharge orders). All discharge medication documentation available in the chart should be reviewed and taken into account by the abstractor.
In cases where there is an antithrombotic in one source that is not mentioned in other sources, it should be interpreted as a discharge medication (select "Yes") unless documentation elsewhere in the medical record suggests that it was NOT prescribed at discharge - Consider it a discharge medication in the absence of contradictory documentation.
If documentation is contradictory (e.g., physician noted “d/c Plavix” in the discharge orders, but Plavix is listed in the discharge summary’s discharge medication list), or after careful examination of circumstances, context, timing, etc., documentation raises enough questions, the case should be deemed "unable to determine" (select "No").
Consider documentation of a hold on an antithrombotic after discharge in one location and a listing of that antithrombotic as a discharge medication in another location as contradictory ONLY if the timeframe on the hold is not defined (e.g., “Hold Plavix”). Examples of a hold with a defined timeframe include “Hold Plavix x2 days” and “Hold ASA until after stress test.”
If an antithrombotic is NOT listed as a discharge medication, and there is only documentation of a hold or plan to delay initiation/restarting of antithrombotic therapy after discharge (e.g., “Hold Plavix x2 days,” “Start Plavix as outpatient,” “Hold Plavix”), select “No”.
If two discharge summaries are included in the medical record, use the one with the latest date/time. If one or both are not dated or timed, and you cannot determine which was done last, use both. This also applies to discharge medication reconciliation forms. Use the dictated date/time over transcribed date/time, file date/time, etc.
Examples:

Two discharge summaries, one dictated 5/22 (day of discharge) and one dictated 5/27 - Use the 5/27 discharge summary.
Two discharge medication reconciliation forms, one not dated and one dated 4/24 (day of discharge) - Use both.
Disregard an antithrombotic medication documented only as a recommended medication for discharge (e.g., “Recommend sending patient home on aspirin”). Documentation must be clearer that an antithrombotic was actually prescribed at discharge.
Disregard documentation of antithrombotic prescribed at discharge when noted only by medication class (e.g., “Antithrombotic Prescribed at Discharge: Yes” on a core measures form). The antithrombotic must be listed by name.
Prasugrel (Effient) is contraindicated in post ACS/PCI patients with stroke or TIA and is NOT considered an acceptable antithrombotic (antiplatelet) therapy for stroke prevention treatment. If Prasugrel (Effient) is the only antithrombotic medication prescribed at discharge, select “No/ND” here and answer the subsequent data element of "Other Antithrombotic(s) - Prescribed" = "Yes" and choose Prasugrel from the drop down.
EXCEPTION: If Prasugrel (Effient) is prescribed in addition to aspirin, select “Yes” for antithrombotic prescribed at discharge. Note the abstractor should select “Antiplatelet” class and “Aspirin” under medication. The subsequent data element of "Other Antithrombotic(s) - Prescribed" should also be answered as "Yes" and Prasugrel should be selected from the drop down.
Reasons for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at hospital discharge must be documented by a physician/APN/PA or pharmacist.
If reasons are not mentioned in the context of antithrombotics, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that antithrombotic therapy was not prescribed because of a bleeding disorder unless documentation explicitly states so).
Reasons must be explicitly documented (e.g., Active GI bleed – antithrombotic therapy contraindicated”, “No ASA” [no reason given].).
Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a hold on an antithrombotic medication or discontinuation of an antithrombotic medication that occurs during the hospital stay constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at discharge. A hold/discontinuation of all p.o. medications counts if an oral antithrombotic medication (e.g., Plavix) was on order at the time of the notation.
EXCEPTIONS:
Documentation of a conditional hold or discontinuation of an antithrombotic medication (e.g., “Hold ASA if guaiac positive”, “Stop plavix if rash persists,” “No ASA for 24 hours following thrombolytic therapy”).
Discontinuation of a particular antithrombotic medication documented in combination with the start of a different antithrombotic medication (i.e., switch type of antithrombotic medication) does not count as a reason for not prescribing an antithrombotic medication at discharge. 
Examples:
- “Stop Plavix” and “Start Plavix 75 mg po daily” in same physician order
- “Change Plavix to aspirin” in progress note
- “Do not continue after discharge” checked for Plavix and “Continue after discharge” checked for clopidogrel on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Discontinuation of an antithrombotic medication at a particular dose documented in combination with the start of a different dose of that antithrombotic (i.e., change in dosage) does not count as a reason for not prescribing an antithrombotic medication at discharge.
Examples:
- “Stop Ecotrin 300 mg po daily” and “Start Ecotrin 325 mg po daily” in same physician order
- “Increase Ectotrin 81 mg to 325 mg daily” in progress note
- “Do not continue after discharge” checked for Ecotrin 300 mg and “Continue after discharge” checked for Ecotrin 325 mg on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Deferral of antithrombotic therapy from one physician/APN/PA or pharmacist to another does NOT count as a reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at discharge unless the problem underlying the deferral is also noted.
Examples: 
- “Consulting neurologist to evaluate pt. for warfarin therapy.” – DO NOT select “NC”. 
- “Rule out GI bleed. Start ASA if OK with neurology.” - select “NC”.
If there is documentation of a plan to initiate/restart antithrombotic therapy, and the reason/problem underlying the delay in starting/restarting antithrombotic therapy is also noted, this constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at discharge.
Acceptable examples (select “NC”):
- “Stool Occult Blood positive. May start Coumadin as outpatient.”
- “Start ASA if hematuria subsides.”
Unacceptable examples (DO NOT select “NC”):
- “Consider starting Coumadin in a.m.”
- “May add Plavix when pt. can tolerate”
Reasons do NOT need to be documented at discharge or otherwise linked to the discharge timeframe: Documentation of reasons anytime during the hospital stay are acceptable (e.g., mid-hospitalization note stating “no ASA due to rectal bleeding” - select “NC,” even if documentation indicates that the rectal bleeding has resolved by the time of discharge and ASA was restarted).
Crossing out of an antithrombotic medication counts as a "clearly implied reason" for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at discharge only if on a pre-printed form.
An allergy or adverse reaction to one type of antithrombotic would NOT be a reason for not administering all antithrombotics. Another medication can be ordered.
When conflicting information is documented in the medical record, select “NC.”
When the current record includes documentation of a pre-arrival reason for no antithrombotic therapy, the following counts regardless of whether this documentation is included in a pre-arrival record made part of the current record or whether it is noted by hospital staff during the current hospital stay:
Pre-arrival hold/discontinuation or notation such as "No Coumadin" IF the underlying reason/problem is also noted (e.g., “Coumadin held in transferring hospital due to possible GI bleed”).
Pre-arrival "other reason" (other than hold/discontinuation or notation of "No ASA") (e.g., "Hx GI bleeding with ASA" in transferring ED record).
Acceptable reasons for not giving antithrombotic medication at hospital discharge may include:
Allergy to or complication related to antithrombotic
Serious side effect to medication
Aortic dissection
Bleeding disorder
Brain/CNS cancer
CVA, hemorrhagic
Extensive/metastatic CA
Hemorrhage, any type
Intracranial surgery/biopsy
Patient/family refusal
Peptic ulcer
Planned surgery within 7 days following discharge
Risk of bleeding or discontinued due to bleeding
Unrepaired intracranial aneurysm
Terminal Illness
Other documented by physician/APN/PA or pharmacist
Please note: Anticoagulants at doses (low dose) designed to prevent deep vein thrombosis are insufficient as antithrombotic therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA. Conversely, antiplatelet agents at doses to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA are insufficient therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis. However, anticoagulants at full therapeutic doses (such as full dose LMW heparin, unfractionated heparin IV, or warfarin) are considered acceptable treatment options for both DVT prophylaxis and antithrombotic medication.

DVT prevention doses may include:
dalteparin (Fragmin): 2500 or 5000 units SQ every day
enoxaparin (Lovenox): 30-40 mg SQ every day or 2 times a day
fondaparinux (Arixtra): 2.5 mg SQ every day
Heparin: 5000 units SQ every 8-12 hrs
rivaroxaban (Xarelto) Oral: 10 mg every day for prevention of DVT after hip surgery
Therapeutic doses, that may prevent DVT and also be effective as therapeutic anticoagulation to prevent stroke, may include:These doses are provided to aid chart abstraction and not as an endorsement of any of the specific medicines for treatment or prevention of stroke. In many cases these medicines are not approved by the FDA for treatment or prevention of stroke, but could reasonably be used off-label for that purpose.
apixaban (Eliquis): 5mg twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily in patients with two or more of the following: age >/= 80 years, weight </= 60kg, or serum creatinine >/= 1.5mg/dL)
argatroban at any dose IV infusion
dabigatran (Pradaxa): 150 mg 2 times a day (75 mg 2 times a day in patients with renal failure)
dalteparin (Fragmin) : 100 IU/kg SQ every 12hrs
fondaparinux (Arixtra): 5-10 mg SQ every day
Heparin: continuous IV infusion titrated to elevated PTT outside the normal range. Typical ranges could include PTT 50-70 or 60-84; however, IV heparin is not of proven benefit for acute ischemic stroke or secondary prevention of stroke.

Notes for Abstraction:

Therapeutic doses, that may prevent DVT and also be effective as therapeutic anticoagulation to prevent stroke, may include: these doses are provided to aid chart abstraction and not as an endorsement of any of the specific medicines for treatment or prevention of stroke. In many cases these medicines are not approved by the FDA for treatment or prevention of stroke, but could reasonably be used off-label for that purpose.
desirudin (Iprivask): 15 mg every 12 hours
REQUIRED: Persistent or Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter (Was atrial fibrillation/flutter or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), documented during this admission?)

Any evidence of atrial fibrillation or flutter observed or identified during the hospital admission. The medical record should contain documentation by a physician or other provider which describes the episode OR EKG/monitor finding of atrial fibrillation or flutter. This includes persistent or paroxysmal fibrillation/flutter.

Yes
No
Notes for Abstraction:

Documentation of atrial fibrillation or flutter on current EKG, select “Yes”.
Diagnosis of current atrial fibrillation or flutter anywhere in the medical record, select “Yes”.
See the inclusion list for acceptable examples of documentation. The list is not all-inclusive.
Inclusion Guidelines for Abstraction:

AF
A-fib
Atrial fibrillation
Atrial flutter

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
PAF
Examples:

Patient 340a had no prior history of atrial fibrillation. They are admitted with an ischemic stroke and new onset atrial fibrillation is documented in the ED. The patient is discharged on Coumadin for non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Data entry will be to select "Yes" for Persistent or Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter (Data entry for Previously known medical history is NOT to check Atrial Fib/Flutter).
Patient 340b was admitted with the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but the EKG in the ED shows sinus rhythm. Holter monitor during the hospitalization does not show evidence of atrial fibrillation. Data entry will be to select "No" for Persistent or Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter. (Data entry for Previously known medical history is to check Atrial Fib/Flutter)
Patient 340c was admitted with the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and a remote history of a brief period of self-limited atrial fibrillation after bypass surgery 6 years ago and negative Holter monitoring in the years since. The patient is in sinus rhythm and on no current management for AF. There is no evidence of atrial fibrillation during the hospitalization. (Data entry for Previously known medical history is NOT to check Atrial Fib/Flutter and "No" for Persistent or Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter. )
Admission Data, Hospitalization Data, (includes: EKG report, Holter monitor report, rhythm strip with documented interpretation of atrial fibrillation/flutter, transfer sheet), Discharge Data

Summary of Changes

REQUIRED: If atrial fib/flutter or history of PAF documented, was patient discharged on anticoagulation?

Patients with Atrial fib/flutter are at increased risk for stroke. This includes patients who have afib or flutter during the hospital stay or patients who have a history of any Afib/Flutter including PAF documented in the medical record, even without evidence of afib or flutter during the current hospitalization. Even in patients who have undergone catheter ablation therapy there is uncertainty as to what the risk of recurrence of AF is over the long term, AF can recur without symptoms and be unrecognized by the patient or physician. Therefore anticoagulation is still indicated stroke patients with catheter ablation therapy for AF.

Yes: Anticoagulation therapy was prescribed at discharge.
No/ND: Anticoagulation therapy was not prescribed at discharge or unable to determine from medical record documentation.
NC: There is documentation of a reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge
Notes for Abstraction:

See Table 5 for a list of medications used for anticoagulation therapy :
Select "No/ND" for patients who are discharged only on low doses (5000 units subQ bid) of heparin or equivalent doses for DVT prophylaxis using LMWH
Select “No/ND” for patients who are discharged only on antiplatelet therapy, without anticoagulation therapy
In determining whether anticoagulation therapy was prescribed at discharge, it is not uncommon to see conflicting documentation amongst different medical record sources. For example, the discharge summary may list an anticoagulant that is not included in any of the other discharge medication sources (e.g., discharge orders). All discharge medication documentation available in the chart should be reviewed and taken into account by the abstractor.
In cases where there is an anticoagulant in one source that is not mentioned in other sources, it should be interpreted as a discharge medication (select "Yes") unless documentation elsewhere in the medical record suggests that it was NOT prescribed at discharge - Consider it a discharge medication in the absence of contradictory documentation.
If documentation is contradictory (e.g., physician noted “d/c Coumadin” in the discharge orders, but Coumadin is listed in the discharge summary’s discharge medication list), or after careful examination of circumstances, context, timing, etc., documentation raises enough questions, the case should be deemed "unable to determine" (select "No").
Consider documentation of a hold on an anticoagulant after discharge in one location and a listing of that anticoagulant as a discharge medication in another location as contradictory ONLY if the timeframe on the hold is not defined (e.g., “Hold Coumadin”). Examples of a hold with a defined timeframe include “Hold Coumadin x2 days” and “Hold warfarin until after stress test.”
If an anticoagulant is NOT listed as a discharge medication, and there is only documentation of a hold or plan to delay initiation/restarting of anticoagulation therapy after discharge (e.g., “Hold Coumadin x2 days,” “Start Coumadin as outpatient,” “Hold Coumadin”), select “No”.
If two discharge summaries are included in the medical record, use the one with the latest date/time. If one or both are not dated or timed, and you cannot determine which was done last, use both. This also applies to discharge medication reconciliation forms. Use the dictated date/time over transcribed date/time, file date/time, etc. 
Examples:
− Two discharge summaries, one dictated 5/22 (day of discharge) and one dictated 5/27 - Use the 5/27 discharge summary.
− Two discharge medication reconciliation forms, one not dated and one dated 4/24 (day of discharge) - Use both.
Disregard an anticoagulant medication documented only as a recommended medication for discharge (e.g., “Recommend sending patient home on dabigatran”). Documentation must be clearer that an anticoagulant was actually prescribed at discharge.
Disregard documentation of anticoagulant prescribed at discharge when noted only by medication class (e.g., “Anticoagulant Prescribed at Discharge: Yes” on a core measures form). The anticoagulant must be listed by name.
Reasons for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy must be documented by a physician, advance practice nurse or physician assistant.
If reasons are not mentioned in the context of anticoagulation therapy, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that anticoagulation therapy was not prescribed because of a bleeding disorder unless documentation explicitly states so).
Reasons must be explicitly documented (e.g., “Active GI bleed – anticoagulation therapy contraindicated”, “No warfarin” [no reason given].).
Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a hold on an anticoagulant medication or discontinuation of an anticoagulant medication that occurs during the hospital stay constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at discharge. A hold/discontinuation of all p.o. medications counts if an oral anticoagulant medication (e.g., warfarin) was on order at the time of the notation.
EXCEPTIONS:
Documentation of a conditional hold or discontinuation of an anticoagulant medication (e.g., “Hold Coumadin if guaiac positive”, “Stop warfarin if rash persists”, “No warfarin for 24 hours post thrombolytic therapy”).
Discontinuation of a particular anticoagulant medication documented in combination with the start of a different anticoagulant medication (i.e., switch type of anticoagulant medication) does not count as a reason for not prescribing an anticoagulant medication at discharge. Examples:
- “Stop warfarin” and “Start warfarin 2 mg po daily” in same physician order
- “Change Coumadin to Pradaxa” in progress note
- Do not continue after discharge” checked for warfarin and “Continue after discharge” checked for Coumadin on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Discontinuation of an anticoagulant medication at a particular dose documented in combination with the start of a different dose of that anticoagulant (i.e., change in dosage) does not count as a reason for not prescribing an anticoagulant medication at discharge. 
Examples:
- “Stop warfarin 5 mg po daily” and “Start warfarin 2.5 mg po daily” in same physician order 
- “Decrease dabigatran 150 mg po BID to 75 mg po BID” in progress note 
- Do not continue after discharge” checked for Coumadin 5 mg and “Continue after discharge” check for Coumadin 2.5 mg on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Deferral of anticoagulation therapy from one physician/APN/PA or pharmacist to another does NOT count as a reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at discharge unless the problem underlying the deferral is also noted. Examples:
“Consulting neurologist to evaluate pt. for warfarin therapy.” - select “No”.
“Rule out GI bleed. Start Coumadin if OK with neurology.” - select "Yes”.
If there is documentation of a plan to initiate/restart anticoagulation therapy, and the reason/problem underlying the delay in starting/restarting anticoagulation therapy is also noted, this constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at discharge.
Acceptable examples (select “Yes”):
“Stool Occult Blood positive. May start Coumadin as outpatient.”
“Start warfarin if hematuria subsides.”
Unacceptable examples (select “No”):
“Consider starting Coumadin in a.m.”
“May add warfarin when pt. can tolerate
Reasons do NOT need to be documented at discharge or otherwise linked to the discharge timeframe: Documentation of reasons anytime during the hospital stay are acceptable (e.g., mid-hospitalization note stating “no warfarin due to rectal bleeding” - select “Yes,” even if documentation indicates that the rectal bleeding has resolved by the time of discharge and warfarin was restarted).
Crossing out of an anticoagulant medication counts as a "clearly implied reason" for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at discharge only if on a pre-printed form.
An allergy or adverse reaction to one type of anticoagulant would NOT be a reason for not administering all anticoagulants. Another medication can be ordered.
When the current record includes documentation of a pre-arrival reason for no anticoagulation therapy, the following counts regardless of whether this documentation is included in a pre-arrival record made part of the current record or whether it is noted by hospital staff during the current hospital stay:
Pre-arrival hold/discontinuation or notation such as "No Coumadin" IF the underlying reason/problem is also noted (e.g., “Coumadin held in transferring hospital due to possible GI bleed”)
Pre-arrival "other reason" (other than hold/discontinuation or notation of "No warfarin") (e.g., "Hx GI bleeding with warfarin" in transferring ED record).
Reasons for not PRESCRIBING anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge:
Allergy to all anticoagulant medications
Aortic dissection
Bleeding disorder
Brain/CNS cancer
CVA, hemorrhagic
Extensive/metastatic CA
Hemorrhage, any type
Intracranial surgery/biopsy
Patient/family refusal

REQUIRED FOR COVERDELL ONLY: Antihypertensive Tx

Determine if antihypertensive treatment was prescribed at discharge. The appropriate time to initiate antihypertensive medication in the setting of acute ischemic stroke is unknown. However, many patients are discharged on antihypertensive medications. Record all agents based on class of action. For combination agents, record both classes. Select the class of medication regardless of the indication for this medication. Medications in these classes may be used to treat alternate conditions beyond hypertension. A list of anti-hypertensive medications can be found in Table 1.

None prescribed/ND
None - contraindicated
ACE Inhibitors
ARB
Beta Blockers
Ca++ Channel Blockers
Diuretics

Examples:

Patient 350a is admitted to the in-patient unit with right hemiparesis and dysarthria. His pre-admission medications were lisinopril, aspirin, metformin and furosemide. His metformin is held but all other medications are continued. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is noted during admission but he returns to sinus rhythm spontaneously. He is discharged on day 5 on his original pre-admission medications and the DASH diet. Data Entry will be to multi-select "ACE Inhibitors" and "Diuretics".
The notes for Patient 350b document critical intracranial stenosis. At discharge his blood pressure is 100/60 and his lisinopril and furosemide were held with a plan to restart if BP increases. Data entry would be to select "None - contraindicated".

REQUIRED: Cholesterol-Reducing Tx (Select all that apply)

Enter the cholesterol reducing medication the patient has been prescribed upon discharge.

None prescribed/ND: Cholesterol reducing treatment was not prescribed at discharge or unable to determine from medical record documentation
None contraindicated: There is documentation of a reason for not prescribing cholesterol reducing treatment at discharge
Statin: See Table 2 for a list statin containing medications
Fibrate: See Table 2 for a list of fibrate medications
Niacin: See Table 2 for a list of niacin containing medications
Absorption Inhibitor: See Table 2 for a list of absorption inhibitor containing medications
Other med: See Table 2 for a list of other medications
Notes for Abstraction:

In determining whether cholesterol reducing therapy was prescribed at discharge, it is not uncommon to see conflicting documentation among different medical record sources. For example, the discharge summary may list a drug that is not included in any of the other discharge medication sources (e.g., discharge orders). All discharge medication documentation available in the medical record should be reviewed and taken into account by the abstractor.
In cases where there is a cholesterol reducing drug noted in one source that is not mentioned in other sources, it should be interpreted as a discharge medication (select the specified class of cholesterol reducer) unless documentation elsewhere in the medical records suggest that it was NOT prescribed at discharge – Consider it a discharge medication in the absence of contradictory documentation.
If documentation is contradictory (e.g., MD noted discontinuation of the cholesterol reducing therapy in the discharge medication orders, but it is listed in the discharge summary’s discharge medication list), or after careful examination of circumstances, context, timing, etc., documentation raises enough questions, the case should be deemed “unable to determine” (select “None prescribed/ND”).
When there is a documented plan to delay initiation/restarting of a cholesterol reducing therapy for a time period after discharge, select “None prescribed/ND”.
For combination agents, select both medication classes. (e.g. Patient is prescribed Vytorin, select “Statin” AND “Absorption inhibitor”
Reasons for not prescribing cholesterol reducing medication must be documented by a physician, advance practice nurse or physician assistant
If reasons are not mentioned in the context of cholesterol reducing treatment, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that cholesterol reducing medication is not being prescribed because of a history of ICH unless documentation explicitly states so.)
Documented reasons for not prescribing cholesterol reducing treatment may include (list is not all-inclusive):
Allergy to or complication related to cholesterol reducing treatment
Documentation of an allergy/sensitivity to one particular statin medication is acceptable to take as an allergy to the entire class of statin medications (e.g., “Allergic to Lipitor”).
An allergy or adverse reaction to one class of cholesterol reducing medications would NOT be a reason for not administering all cholesterol reducing medications. Another medication class can be ordered. (e.g. If patient is allergic to statins, a fibrate could be prescribed).
Patient/family refusal
Terminal illness/Comfort Measures Only
Hepatitis
Hepatic failure
Myalgias
Rhabdomyolysis
ICH within prior 6 months
Patient does not meet ATP III criteria and has a stroke not of atherosclerotic origins,
Patients who meet Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria (1) should receive lipid-lowering therapy. The conditions that reflect systemic atherosclerosis and therefore meet ATP III criteria include: Clinical coronary heart disease; symptomatic carotid artery disease; peripheral arterial disease; abdominal aortic aneurysm and diabetes mellitus. Patient may also meet ATP III criteria based on their Framingham Risk score.
Example: Patient 360a is admitted to the in-patient unit with right hemiparesis and dysarthria. His pre-admission medications were lisinopril, aspirin, metformin and furosemide. His metformin is held but all other medications are continued. LDL is noted to be 180 and he has a recent non-q wave MI. He is discharged on day 5 on his original pre-admission medications and pravastatin plus a low-cholesterol diet. Data entry will be to select "Statin".

REQUIRED: Statin Medication (Specify)

Select from the list the specific statin containing medication and the total daily dosage that was prescribed at discharge.

Notes for Abstraction:

Statin medications are routinely prescribed to be taken once daily. If the patient is prescribed a statin dose to be taken more than once daily, add the individual doses and enter as “Total Daily Dosage.”
If the patient is prescribed Atorvastatin(Lipitor) at a total daily dose of 40 mg or greater, select “ >= 40 mg”. 40 mg is the minimum daily dosage which qualifies as intensive statin therapy. For all other dosages, select the specific total daily dose prescribed.
If the patient is prescribed Rosuvastatin (Crestor) at a total daily dose of 20 mg or greater, select >= 20 mg. 20 mg is the minimum daily dosage which qualifies as intensive statin therapy. For all other dosages, select the specific total daily dose prescribed.

REQUIRED: Documented reason for not prescribing a statin medication at discharge?

Element definition from Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures

Reasons for not prescribing a statin medication at discharge:

Statin medication allergy
Other reasons documented by physician/advanced practice nurse/physician assistant (physician/APN/PA) or pharmacist
LDL-c less than 70 mg/dL
Statins are a class of pharmaceutical agents that modify LDL cholesterol by blocking the action of an enzyme in the liver which is needed to synthesize cholesterol thereby decreasing the level of cholesterol circulating in the blood.

Yes (There is documentation of a reason for not prescribing a statin medication at discharge.)

No ( There is no documentation of a reason for not prescribing a statin medication at discharge, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.)

Notes for Abstraction:

A statin medication "allergy" or "sensitivity" documented at anytime during the hospital stay counts as an allergy regardless of what type of reaction might be noted (e.g., "Allergies: Atorvastatin - Nausea" - select "Yes.").
Documentation of an allergy/sensitivity to one particular statin medication is acceptable to take as an allergy to the entire class of statin medications (e.g., "Allergic to Lipitor").
Documentation of a LDL-c less than 70 mg/dL anytime during the hospital stay is an acceptable stand-alone reason for not prescribing statin medication at discharge – Linkage with statin is not needed. If more than one LDL value is documented, the highest value must be less than 70 mg/dL. Direct or calculated fasting or non-fasting values are both acceptable. LDL values obtained within 30 days prior to hospital arrival are acceptable to select “Yes.”
When conflicting information is documented in a medical record, select "Yes".
Reasons for not administering statin therapy must be documented by a physician/APN/PA or pharmacist with one exception: Patient/family refusal of any form of statin therapy (e.g., “Lipitor refused,” “Patient refusing statin therapy”) may be documented by a nurse.
In determining whether there is a reason documented by physician/APN/PA or pharmacist for not prescribing a statin medication at discharge:
Reasons must be explicitly documented (e.g., "Chronic liver failure - Statins contraindicated", "Hx muscle soreness with statins in past") or clearly implied (e.g., "No evidence of atherosclerosis - no statin therapy", "Pt. refusing all medications," "Supportive care only - no medication," statin medication on pre-printed order form is crossed out, "Statins not indicated," "No statin medications" [no reason given]). If reasons are not mentioned in the context of statin medications, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that a statin medication is not being prescribed because of the patient's history of alcoholism or severe liver disease alone).
Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a hold on a statin medication or discontinuation of a statin medication that occurs during the hospital stay constitutes a "clearly implied" reason for not prescribing a statin medication at discharge. A hold/discontinuation of all p.o. medications counts if statin medication p.o. was on order at the time of the notation.
EXCEPTIONS:
Documentation of a conditional hold or discontinuation of a statin medication (e.g., "Hold Zocor if severe diarrhea persists," "Stop atorvastatin if myalgias persist").
Discontinuation of a particular statin medication documented in combination with the start of a different statin medication (i.e., switch in type of statin medication) does not count as a reason for not prescribing a statin medication at discharge.
Examples:
“Stop lovastatin” and “Start atorvastatin 80 mg po q hs” in same physician order
“Change Crestor to Lipitor” in progress note
“Do not continue after discharge” checked for Vytorin and “Continue after discharge” checked for Advicor on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Discontinuation of a statin medication at a particular dose documented in combination with the start of a different dose of that statin (i.e., change in dosage) does not count as a reason for not prescribing a statin medication at discharge.
Examples:
“Stop Simvastatin 20 mg po q hs” and “Start Simvastatin 40 mg po q hs” in same physician order
“Increase Pravachol 40 mg to 80 mg” in progress note
“Do not continue after discharge” checked for Zocor 40 mg and “Continue after discharge” checked for Zocor 80 mg on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Reason documentation which refers to a more general medication class is not acceptable (e.g., “No cholesterol-reducers”, “Hold all lipid-lowering medications”).
Deferral of statin medication from one physician/APN/PA or pharmacist to another does NOT count as a reason for not prescribing a statin medication unless the problem underlying the deferral is also noted.
Examples:
" Consulting neurologist to evaluate pt. for statin therapy" - select " No. "
"Severe diarrhea.  Start statin if OK with neurology." - select " Yes ."
If there is documentation of a plan to initiate/restart a statin medication, and the reason/problem underlying the delay in starting/restarting the medication is also noted, this constitutes a "clearly implied" reason for not prescribing a statin medication at discharge.
Acceptable examples (select "Yes"):
"Liver enzymes high. May start lovastatin as outpatient."
"Add statin if myalgias resolve"
Unacceptable examples (select "No"):
"Consider starting statins in a.m."
"May add Zocor when pt. can tolerate."
Reasons do NOT need to be documented at discharge or otherwise linked to the discharge timeframe: Documentation of reasons anytime during the hospital stay are acceptable (e.g., mid-hospitalization note stating "no statin medications due to abnormal liver enzymes" - select "Yes," even if documentation indicates that the liver enzyme levels normalized by the time of discharge and the lipid-lowering medication was restarted).
Crossing out of a statin medication counts as a "clearly implied reason" for not prescribing statin medication at discharge only if on a pre-printed form.
Statin medications may also be referred to as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors
When the current record includes documentation of a pre-arrival reason for no statin medication, the following counts regardless of whether this documentation is included in a pre-arrival record made part of the current record or whether it is noted by hospital staff during the current hospital stay:
Pre-arrival statin medication allergy
Pre-arrival hold/discontinuation or notation such as "No stain medications" IF the underlying reason/problem is also noted (e.g., "Lipitor discontinued in transferring hospital secondary to severe diarrhea").
Pre-arrival "other reason" (other than hold/discontinuation or notation of "No statin medications") (e.g., "Hx muscle soreness to statins in past" in transferring ED record).

Summary of Changes

OPTIONAL: Intensive Statin Therapy

Was the patient prescribed statin therapy with intensive lipid-lowering effects?

The 2008 Update to the AHA/ASA Recommendations for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack contains the following Class I recommendation: "On the basis of the SPARCL trial, administration of statin therapy with intensive lipid- lowering effects is recommended for patients with atherosclerotic ischemic stroke or TIA and without known CHD to reduce the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events."

Yes: The patient was prescribed a statin medication that qualifies as intensive statin therapy.
No/ND: The patient was not prescribed a statin medication that qualifies as intensive statin therapy or unable to determine from the medical record.
NC: There is documentation in the medical record of a reason for not prescribing intensive statin therapy at discharge.
Notes for Abstraction:

Select “Yes” only if the patient was prescribed one of the statin medications and dosage indicated as intensive statin therapy. Statin therapy with intensive lipid-lowering effects may be defined as those statin agents and doses which have been demonstrated to produce a mean LDL reduction of approximately 50% or greater: The following statins and total daily dose meet this criteria on the basis of published studies:
Atorvastatin (Lipitor) 40 mg or 80 mg total daily dose
Rosuvastatin (Crestor) 20 mg or 40 mg total daily dose
Simvastatin (Zocor or generic) 80 mg total daily dose*
Simvastatin/Ezetimibe (Vytorin) 10/80 mg dose*
*According to the June 8, 2011 FDA safety announcement physicians should limit using the simvastatin 80-mg dose unless the patient has already been taking the drug for 12 months and there is no evidence of myopathy. Simvastatin 80 mg alone or in combination with ezetimibe (Vytorin) should not be started in new patients, including patients already taking lower doses of the drug. http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm256581.htm Physicians should limit using the simvastatin 80-mg dose unless the patient has already been taking the drug for 12 months and there is no evidence of myopathy. Simvastatin 80 mg alone or in combination with ezetimibe (Vytorin) should not be started in new patients, including patients already taking lower doses of the drug.

It should be noted that the SPARCL trial studied the Atorvastatin 80 mg daily compared to placebo. The AHA/ASA guideline recommendation generalizes this finding to include other statin therapy with intensive lipid lowering effects. This recommendation conforms with AHA Guideline Development policy that assumes a class effect in the absence of data to the contrary.

Reasons for not prescribing intensive statin therapy at discharge must be documented by a physician, PA, or APN.
If there is a documented contraindication to statin medication, this suffices as documentation of a contraindication to intensive statin therapy without explicit mention of intensive statin therapy. Reasons may include(list is not all inclusive):
Allergy to or complication related to statin therapy (history or current)
Patient/Family refused including patient preference for a less expensive, comparable alternative drug due to economic concerns (inability to pay).
Serious side effect to medication
Terminal illness/Comfort Measures Only
ICH within prior 6 months
If the patient does NOT have a documented contraindication to statin medication reasons for no intensive statin therapy must be mentioned in the context of intensive statin therapy, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that intensive statin therapy is not being prescribed because of a recorded LDL value of <100mg/dL unless documentation explicitly states so.)
Select “NC” if there is explicit documentation (do not make inferences) that intensive statin therapy is not indicated because the patient:
Presently is achieving target LDL or LDL<100 spontaneously or by medical therapy,
Has no evidence of atherosclerosis
Has both CHD and ischemic stroke but there is documentation in the record as to why intensive statin therapy or an LDL goal of < 70mg/dL is not indicated
Has presence of hypertriglyceridemia (high triglycerides) that warrants treatment with an alternative lipid lowering agent such as a fibrate.
 
Examples:

Patient 370a with a high grade carotid stenosis and evidence of elevated cholesterol and other vascular risk factors is prescribed atorvastatin 80 mg po qd. Select "Yes".
Patient 370b with a high grade carotid stenosis and LDL measurement of 90. The patient was taking atorvastatin 20 mg prior to admission and was discharged on atorvastatin 20 mg po qd. Select “No”.
Patient 370c was admitted with a cardio embolic ischemic stroke and no other vascular risk factors. The patient has elevated cholesterol with LDL measurement of 115 mg/dL and is discharged on atorvastatin 20 mg. The physician documents that the patient is not a candidate for intensive statin therapy due to no atherosclerosis. Select “NC”

Select the "Check all as Yes" to quickly answer "Yes" to all five Education questions.

REQUIRED: Risk Factors for Stroke

Documentation that the patient/caregiver received educational materials that address risk factors for stroke. Patient education programs for specific chronic conditions have increased healthful behaviors, improved health status, and/or decreased health care costs of their participants.

Yes - WRITTEN instructions/educational material given to patient/caregiver address risk factors for stroke.

No - WRITTEN instructions/educational material given to patient/caregiver do not address risk factors for stroke, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

Educational material must specifically address risk factors for stroke:
Example:
Stroke Risk Factors:
Overweight
Smoking
Sedentary lifestyle
See the inclusion list for acceptable risk factors for stroke. The list is not all-inclusive.
Individual risk factors that are not mentioned in the context of education provided on the risk factors for stroke, do not count (e.g., discharge instruction to limit alcohol without explicit documentation that excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for stroke).
If individual risk factors are mentioned in the context of education provided on the risk factors for stroke, then it may be inferred that the education was personalized and patient-specific.
Educational material which addresses risk factors for transient ischemic attack (TIA) is
acceptable.
Documentation of education which does not include stroke and risk factors, select
“No."
Examples:
Stroke binder given to patient's family.�€�
�€œAneurysm education completed.�€�
If documentation reflects that educational material regarding risk factors for stroke was given to the patient/caregiver, select �€œYes�€�, even if a copy of the material is not present in the medical record.
Documentation must clearly convey that the patient/caregiver was given a copy of the material to take home. When the material is present in the medical record and there is no documentation which clearly suggests that a copy was given, the inference should be made that it was given IF the patient's name or the medical record number appears on the material AND hospital staff or the patient/caregiver has signed the material. This applies to educational materials in the form of discharge instruction sheets, brochures, booklets, teaching sheets, videos, CDs, DVDs or other patient-oriented materials. Providing a link to electronic materials is not sufficient.
Use only documentation provided in the medical record itself. Do not review and use outside materials in abstraction. Do not make assumptions about what content may be covered in material documented as given to the patient/caregiver.
Written instructions given anytime during the hospital stay are acceptable.
If the patient refused written instructions/material which addressed risk factors for stroke , select "Yes."
If documentation indicates that written instructions/material on risk factors for stroke were not given because the patient is cognitively impaired (e.g., comatose, obtunded, confused, short-term memory loss) and has no caregiver available, select "Yes".
The caregiver is defined as the patient's family or any other person (e.g., home health/VNA provider, prison official or other law enforcement personnel) who will be responsible for care of the patient after discharge.

REQUIRED: Their prescribed medications

Documentation that the patient/caregiver received educational materials that address all medications prescribed at discharge. Instructions must address at least the names of all discharge medications but may also include other usage instructions such as dosages, frequencies, side effects, etc. The importance of medications prescribed to prevent a second stroke (e.g., Plavix) should be emphasized.

Yes - WRITTEN instructions/educational material given to patient/caregiver address discharge medications.

No - WRITTEN instructions/educational material do not address all discharge medications, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.

NOTE: The sections regarding full medication reconciliation, as described below, are ONLY required for those sites collecting for The Joint Commission (PSC and Core Measures). All others still need to provide stroke education as detailed above, but full medication reconciliation is not required as part of the stroke education measure.

Abstraction is a two-step process:
1. Compile a list of all of the medications being prescribed at discharge, based on available medical record documentation.

ALL discharge medication documentation in the chart should be reviewed and taken into account by the abstractor.
Discharge medication information included in a discharge summary dated after discharge should be used as long as it was added within 30 days after discharge
If two discharge summaries are included in the medical record, use the one with the latest date/time. If one or both are not dated or timed, and you cannot determine which was done last, use both. This also applies to discharge medication reconciliation forms. Use the dictated date/time over transcribed date/time, file date/time, etc.
Examples
Two discharge summaries, one dictated 5/22 (day of discharge) and one dictated 5/27 - Use the 5/27 discharge summary.
Two discharge medication reconciliation forms, one not dated and one dated 4/24 (day of discharge) - Use both.
If discharge medications are noted using only references such as �€œcontinue home meds,�€� �€œresume other meds,�€� or �€œsame medications,�€� rather than lists of the names of the discharge medications, the abstractor should use all sources to compile a list of medications the patient was on prior to arrival (or in the case of acute care transfers, use the medications the patient was on prior to arrival at the first hospital).
Discharge medications can be listed in any of the acceptable data sources to be considered a discharge medication. If there is a medication in one source that is not mentioned in other sources, consider it a discharge medication.
Example:
Discharge orders list Lasix but the discharge medication reconciliation form does not mention Lasix. Consider Lasix a discharge medication.
If there is documentation in the medical record that specifically states a medication was NOT prescribed at discharge, do not consider it a discharge medication.
If documentation is contradictory (e.g., physician noted “d/c ASA” in the discharge orders, but it is listed in the discharge summary’s discharge medication list), or, after careful examination of circumstances, context, timing, etc., documentation is still unclear, the case should be deemed "unable to determine” (select "No”).
If there is documentation of a plan to start/restart a medication after discharge or a hold has been placed on a medication for a defined timeframe after discharge (e.g.,“Start Plavix as outpatient,” “Hold Lasix x 2 days,” “Hold ASA until after endoscopy”), consider this a discharge medication requiring education.
Disregard a medication documented only as a recommended medication for discharge. e.g., �€œRecommend sending patient home on Vasotec.�€� Documentation must reflect that the medication was actually prescribed at discharge.
If a medication name is missing from a discharge medication source, disregard the medication.
Disregard a discharge medication list labeled as preliminary�€� or �€œinterim�€�.
As needed (PRN) medications are required on the discharge instructions, with ONE exception: When discharge medications outside of the written discharge instructions are noted using ONLY references such as “continue current medications” or “continue present meds,” rather than lists of the names of the discharge medications, and the abstractor is referencing what medications the patient was taking on the day of
discharge (for comparison against the written discharge instructions, to confirm completeness of that list), medications which are clearly listed as PRN (given on an as needed basis only) do NOT need to be included in the instructions.
Medications which the patient will not be taking at home (and/or the caregiver will not be giving at home) are NOT required in the medication list included in the written discharge instructions (e.g., monthly B12 injections, dialysis meds, chemotherapy).
2. Check this list of discharge medications against the written discharge instructions given to the patient to ensure that the discharge instructions addressed at least the names of all of the discharge medications prescribed. If medications are included in the discharge instructions that are not on the a list of discharge medications, or discharge medications are missing from the list in the instructions and it cannot be determined that the list of medications in the instructions is complete, then the case should be deemed �€œunable to determine�€� (select �€œNo�€�).
Example:
Lasix is a medication listed on the discharge instruction sheet but Lasix is not in the discharge summary or documented as a discharge medication elsewhere in the medical record, select �€œNo.�€�

EXCEPTION: Medications listed on the discharge instructions but not mentioned as discharge medications elsewhere in the medical record are acceptable if the physician/APN/PA has signed or initialed the discharge instructions. Signatures that are dated/ timed after discharge are not acceptable.
Example:
Discharge instruction sheet lists Plavix and aspirin. No other mention of Plavix or aspirin as a discharge medication in the medical record. Discharge instruction sheet is signed by Dr. X �€“ Select �€œYes.�€�
In making medication name comparisons, consider two medications that are brand/trade name vs. generic name in nature or that have the same generic equivalent as matches.
Examples of matches:
Coumadin vs. Warfarin
ASA vs. EC ASA
Plavix vs. Clopidogrel
Mevacor vs. Lovastatin
Lopressor vs. Metoprolol
Metoprolol vs. Metoprolol succinate
If there is documentation that the patient was discharged on insulin(s) of ANY kind, ANY reference to insulin as a discharge medication in the written discharge instructions can be considered a match, for the purposes of the Stroke Education measure (STK-8). E.g., D/C summary notes patient discharged on �€œHumulin Insulin�€� and �€œInsulin 70/30�€� is listed on the discharge instruction sheet �€“ Consider this a match. However, contradictory documentation abstraction guidelines still apply to insulin cases (e.g., D/C summary notes patient discharged on �€œNovolog 50 unit�€™s t.i.d.�€� and �€œNovolog 50 unit�€™s t.i.d.�€� is discontinued on discharge medication reconciliation form �€“ Select �€œNo�€�).
Medications must be listed on the discharge instruction by name. Documentation to continue home medications without documentation of home medications listed by name, select �€œNo.�€�
Do not give credit in cases where there is a reference to a medication by class only on the written discharge instructions, (e.g., “Continue ACEI Inhibitor”), select “No.”
Do not give credit in cases where the patient was given written discharge medication instructions only in the form of written prescriptions.
Documentation must clearly convey that the patient/caregiver was given a copy of the discharge instructions to take home which listed all discharge medications prescribed for the patient by name. When the discharge instructions are present in the medical
record and there is no documentation which clearly suggests that a copy was given, the inference should be made that it was given IF the patient's name or the medical record number appears on the material AND hospital staff or the patient/caregiver has
signed the material.
Use only documentation provided in the medical record itself. Do not review and use outside materials in abstraction. Do not make assumptions about what content may be covered in material documented as given to the patient/caregiver.
Written instructions given or sent to the patient/caregiver after discharge, select “No.”
If the patient refused written discharge instructions/material which addressed discharge medications, select “Yes.”
If documentation indicates that written instructions/material on discharge medications were not given because the patient is cognitively impaired (e.g., comatose, obtunded, confused, short-term memory loss) and has no caregiver available, select “Yes.”
The caregiver is defined as the patient’s family or any other person (e.g.,home health, VNA provider, prison official or other law enforcement personnel) who will be responsible for care of the patient after discharge.

[Data element is found on the Stroke Post-Discharge Follow-Up Form, Comprehensive Stroke Follow-Up Tab]
Element definition from The Joint Commission Comprehensive Stroke Performance Measurement Implementation Guide

Data Element Name: Modified Rankin Score (mRS)

Collected For: CSTK-02

Definition: Documentation in the medical record of a Modified Rankin Score (mRS). The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a 6 point disability scale with possible scores ranging from 0 to 5. A separate category of 6 is usually added for patients who expire. The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is the most widely used outcome measure in stroke clinical trials. Standardized interviews to obtain a mRS score are recommended at 3 months (90 days) following hospital discharge.

Suggested Data Collection Question: What is the patients Modified Rankin Score (mRS) at 90 days post-discharge?

Format

Length: 1
Type: Alphanumeric
Occurs: 1

Allowable Values: 

0 The patient has no residual symptoms. 

1 The patient has no significant disability; able to carry out all pre-stroke acitivities. 

2 The patient has slight disability; unable to carry out all pre-stroke activities but able to look after self without daily help. 

3 The patient has moderate disability; requiring some external help but able to walk without the assistance of another individual. 

4 The patient has moderately severe disability; unable to walk or attend to bodily functions without assistance of another individual. 

5 The patient has severe disability; bedridden, incontinent, requires continuous care. 

6 The patient has expired (during the hospital stay or after discharge from the hospital).

7 Unable to contact patient/caregiver. 

8 Modified Rankin Score not performed, OR unable to determine (UTD) from the medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

Modified Rankin Score (mRS) may be documented by the physician/APN/PA, nurse (RN), medical assistant, or any individual trained to perform the mRS.
No value should be recorded more than once.
If value 8 (UTD) is selected, no other values should be selected.
Select the value (values 0-6) corresponding to the mRS documented at 90 days post-discharge.
If more than one value is documented at 90 days, select the highest value.
If a score range is documented, e.g. 2-3, select the higher value.
If no mRS is documented, select UTD.
Documentation of a mRS obtained within the 90 day timeframe (i.e., 75 to 105 days after hospital discharge) via telephone or in-person is acceptable.
If the patient cannot be interviewed because of communication deficits or other limitations, an interview with the patients caregiver is acceptable.
If documentation reflects that after 3 attempts to contact the patient and/or caregiver, the mRS could not be obtained because attempts to contact the patient and/or caregiver were unsuccessful, select allowable value 7.
EXAMPLES:
Home phone number provided at discharge is a wrong number, AND no e-mail address or other contact information was provided by the patient and/or caregiver at discharge.
Calls placed go to a voicemail system. Message left for patient and/or caregiver requesting a return phone call, but no return call received.
Calls placed within the 90 day timeframe. Message left for patient and/or caregiver. Call returned after 105 days.
If documentation reflects that the mRS could not be obtained due to a language barrier with the patient and/or caregiver, and no hospital or patient translator was available to interpret, select allowable value "7".
If the patient and/or caregiver refuse to be interviewed, select allowable value "7".
If documentation reflects that the mRS could not be obtained because the patient is a resident of a nursing home or extended/immediate care facility, and the facility refuses to provide patient information due to HIPPA regulations or other reasons, select allowable value "7".
The caregiver is defined as the patients family or other person (e.g. home health, VNA provider, prison official or law enforcement personnel) who will be responsible for care of the patient after discharge.

Definition: The month, date, and year that the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) was obtained post-discharge. The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a 6 point disability scale with possible scores ranging from 0 to 5. A separate category of 6 is usually added for patients who expire. The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is the most widely used outcome measure in stroke clinical trials.

Allowable Values: 

MM = Month (01-12)
DD = Day (01-31)
YYYY = Year (2012-Current Year)
UTD = Unable to Determine

Notes for Abstraction:

The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) should be done at 90 days (i.e., plus or minus 15 days; ≥ 75 days and ≤ 105 days) following the patients discharge from the hospital. When multiple dates are recorded during this timeframe, use the earliest date in the 90-day period for the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) Date.
Example: Discharge Date 02-22-20XX. First mRS dated 05-25-20XX. Second mRS dated 06-01-20XX. Select 05-25-20XX for the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) Date.
If a Modified Rankin Score (mRS) was obtained sooner than 75 days post-discharge and no mRS is dated within the 90-day timeframe, select the date for the score closest to 75 days for the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) Date.
Example: Discharge Date 02-22-20XX. First mRS dated 05-18-20XX. Second mRS dated 07-01-20XX. Select 05-18-20XX for the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) Date.
If a Modified Rankin Score (mRS) was obtained later than 105 days post-discharge and no mRS is dated within the 90-day timeframe, select the date for the score closest to 105 days for the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) Date.
Example: Discharge Date 02-22-20XX. First mRS dated 07-01-20XX. Second mRS dated 08-10-20XX. Select 07-01-20XX for the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) Date.
If a discrepancy exists in date documentation from different sources, choose the earliest date. If there are two or more mRS dates (either different mRS episodes or corresponding with the same episode), enter the earliest date.
For patients who expire during the hospital stay, use the Discharge Date for the Modified Rankin Score Date.
For patients who expire after hospital discharge, select the date of the interview call or visit which notified the hospital of the patient’s death and not the actual date of death. If a Modified Rankin Score was not done because the hospital was notified of the patient's death prior to the interview call or visit, select the date of the notification for the Modified Rankin Score Date.
Examples:
Patient discharged home on 12-16-20XX. Telephone mRS done on 03-22-20XX. Family informs interviewer that patient expired at home on 03-01- 20XX. Select 03-22-20XX, the date of the interview call, for the Modified
Rankin Score Date.
Patient discharged home on 12-16-20XX. Outpatient visit scheduled for 01-16-20XX. Appointment cancelled in the EHR on 12-30-20Xx with a note that patient expired at home. Select 12-30-20XX for the Modified Rankin Score Date.
If Modified Rankin Score allowable value '7' was chosen, select the date of the last attempt to contact the patient. If more than three unsuccessful attempts, then use the date of the third attempt.
If the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) Date is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD.
Example:
Documentation indicates the mRS date was 03-42-20xx. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the mRS date is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for Day, it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select UTD. 
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for Modified Rankin Score (mRS) Date allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.

Special Initiatives (Prehospital Care) Tab

EMS refers to the full scope of prehospital stroke care, including 9-1-1 activation and dispath emergency medical response, triage and stabilization in the field, and ground or air ambulance transport.

Several studies have shown that prehospital notification leads to significant reductions in several stroke time benchmarks, including time from arrival to physician assessment, CT performance, and CT interpretation, and is associated with higher rates of administering IVA alteplase.

This information can be found in the patient care report, the "Vitals" section. Look for Stroke Scale Type.
Examples of nationally recognized pre-hospital stroke screens include:
Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS)
The CPSS was derived from a simplification of the 15-item National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and evaluates the presence or absence of facial palsy, asymmetric arm weakness, and speech abnormalities in potential stroke patients. Speech is tested by asking the patient to repeat the sentence, "The sky is blue in Cincinnati," and abnormality is reported if the patient slurs words, says the wrong words, or is unable to speak.
Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Scale (LAPSS)
The LAPSS is a longer instrument consisting of 4 history items, a blood glucose measurement, and 3 examiniation items designed to detect unilateral motor weakness (facial droop, hand grip, and arm strength).
Modified LAPSS
Vision, aphasia, and neglect (VAN)
Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Scale (MASS)
LA County Department of Social Services (DPSS)
Ontario Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool
Face Arm Speech Time (FAST)
The FAST contains 3 key elements (facial weakness, arm weakness, and speech disturbance) from the CPSS, but avoids the need to repeat a sentence as a measure of speech, instead using assessment of language ability by the paramedic during normal conversation with the patient.

REQUIRED FOR CMS: HIC Number

Definition: Enter the Health Insurance Claim (HIC) Number and/or the Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) 

The Health Insurance Claim Number was created by the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS). The HIC number is an SSN-based number used to identify people with Medicare and to administer the CMS program. 

In April 2018, to reduce medical identity theft, CMS started mailing newly-designed Medicare cards with the new Medicare Beneficiary Identifier, or Medicare Number. People enrolling in Medicare for the first time will be among the first to get the new cards, no matter where they live. Current Medicare beneficiaries will get their new cards on a rolling basis over the coming months. CMS will continue to accept the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) through the transition period.

Question: What is the patient's Health Insurance Claim Number or the Medicare Beneficiary Identifier?

Allowable Values: 1 through - 999,999

General Rules

No embedded dashes or spaces or special characters
Must have both alpha and numeric characters
Alpha characters must be upper case
Length cannot be more than 12 or less than 7 characters
For alphanumeric values, do not allow all numeric values to be 9's For example do not allow 1 alpha + 999999999, etc.
If First Character is Numeric

Suffix rules:

If the first character is numeric, (0-9), then the first 9 characters must be numeric.
For example:
HIC # length - Rule

10 - 9 numeric + 1 alpha

11 - 9 numeric + 1 alpha + 1 numeric Or 9 numeric + 2 alpha

If First Character is Alpha

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: Is there documentation that the date and time of last known well was witnessed or reported?

The date and time prior to hospital arrival at which it was witnessed or reported that the patient was last known to be without the signs and symptoms of the current stroke or at his or her baseline state of health.

Y (Yes) There is documentation that the date and time of last known well was witnessed or reported.

N (No) There is no documentation that the date and time of last known well was witnessed or reported , OR date, time, or both date and time are unknown.

Notes for Abstraction:

Select "Yes" if BOTH a Date and a Time Last Known Well are documented.
Select “No” if there is ANY physician/APN/PA documentation that Last Known Well is “UNKNOWN.” Documentation must explicitly state that the Last Known Well is unknown/uncertain/unclear. Documentation that time of symptom onset is unknown/uncertain/unclear is also acceptable when Time Last Known Well is not documented. If Last Known Well is not explicitly documented as unknown, do not make inferences (e.g. do not assume that patient woke with stroke so Last Known Well unknown unless explicitly documented).
If one physician documents a Time Last Known Well and another documents time of symptom onset unknown, select “Yes.”
If physician documents a Time Last Known Well and nurse/EMS documents Last Known Well unknown, select “Yes.”
If one physician documents Last Known Well unknown and another documents a Time Last Known Well, select “No.” 
EXCEPTION
If the physician documents Last Known Well as unknown and the same physician crosses out unknown or mentions in a later note that Last Known Well is now known with a time documented, select “Yes.”
If the physician documents Last Known Well or stroke/sympton onset unknown as a Reason for Not Initiating IV Thrombolytic and the Last Known Well is also on a Code Stroke Form or elsewhere in the medical record, “unknown” should be disregarded and “Yes” selected.
If the Time Last Known Well is clearly greater than 2 hours prior to hospital arrival AND no time is documented, select “No.”
Example:
“Patient OK last night.” Select “No” because no other documentation of a specific time/time range/time reference was present in the medical record and the time is required for the Time Last Known Well.
If the only Time Last Known Well is documented as a time immediately before hospital arrival without a specific time range in minutes, e.g., “symptoms started just prior to ED arrival,” select “Yes.”
If there is no documentation that Last Known Well or stroke signs/symptoms occurred prior to hospital arrival but there is documentation that Last Known Well first occurred after Arrival Time (e.g., in-house stroke), select “No.”

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: What was the date/time at which the patient was last known to be well or at his or her baseline state of health?

The date/time prior to hospital arrival at which the patient was last known to be without the signs and symptoms of the current stroke or at his or her baseline state of health.

DD = Day (01 - 31)
YYYY = Year (20xx)
HH = Hour (00-23)
MM = Minutes (00-59)
UTD = Unable to Determine
Time must be recorded in military time format. With the exception of midnight and Noon:

If the time is in the a.m., conversion is not required
If the time is in the p.m., add 12 to the clock time hour
Examples:

Midnight - 00:00, Noon - 12:00

5:31 am - 05:31, 5:31 pm - 17:31

11:59 am - 11:59, 11:59 p.m. - 23:59

Note:

00:00 = midnight. If the time is documented as 00:00 11-24-20XX, review supporting documentation to determine if the Date Last Known Well should remain 11-24-20XX or if it should be converted to 11-25-20XX.

When converting Midnight or 24:00 to 00:00 do not forget to change the Date Last Known Well.

Example: Midnight or 24:00 on 11-24- 20XX = 00:00 on 11-25- 20XX .

Notes for Abstraction:

Enter the date associated with the Time Last Known Well.
If the Date Last Known Well is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select "UTD."
EXCEPTION:
If the only Date Last Known Well is documented as a time immediately before hospital arrival without a specific time range in minutes, e.g., �€œsymptoms started just prior to ED arrival,�€� and no other documentation mentioning time last known well is available in the medical record, use the Arrival Time for Date Last Known Well.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at "face value"). When the date documented is obviously in error (not a valid date/format) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select "UTD."
Example:
Documentation indicates the Date Last Known Well was 03- 42 -20XX. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid date. Since the Date Last Known Well is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for "Day," it is not a valid date and the abstractor should select "UTD."
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid date as described above will be rejected from the CMS Clinical Warehouse and the Joint Commission's Data Warehouse. Use of "UTD" for Date Last Known Well allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
If the date last known well is documented as one specific date and entered as Date Last Known Well on a "Code Stroke" form or stroke-specific electronic template, enter that date as the Date Last Known Well. Documentation of Date Last Known Well on a stroke-specific form or template should be selected regardless of other dates last known well documented elsewhere in the medical record.
References in relation to Arrival Date are acceptable (e.g., today, tonight, this evening, and this morning). The Date Last Known Well and the Arrival Date may be the same date or a different date.
Examples:
"Wife reports patient normal this evening until approximately 9 PM." Hospital arrival is 0030 on 12-10-20xx." Date Last Known Well is 12-09-20xx.
"Patient states he felt perfectly fine earlier today. At noon, he began to have trouble seeing." Hospital arrival is 3:59 PM on 12-10-20xx." Date Last Known Well is 12-10-20xx.
If a reference to date last known well is documented without a specific date, enter that date for the Date Last Known Well. If multiple dates are documented, select the earliest date.
Examples:
"Patient last known well today (day of arrival)." Select Arrival Date for Date Last Known Well.
"Patient normal yesterday (day before arrival) documented in H&P and consult note documents that patient was last known to be well on Monday (two days prior to arrival)." Select Monday's date for Date Last Known Well.
The Time Last Known Well must be a time prior to the patient’s Arrival Time. Do no tuse times after hospital arrival for Time Last Known Well.
For times that include "seconds," remove the seconds and record the time as is. 
Example:
15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00
If the Time Last Known Well is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select "UTD." 
EXCEPTION:
If the only Time Last Known Well is documented as a time immediately before hospital arrival without a specific time range in minutes, e.g., "symptoms started just prior to ED arrival," and no other documentation mentioning time last known well is available in the medical record, use the Arrival Time for Time Last Known Well.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at "face value"). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid time) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select "UTD." 
Example:
Documentation indicates the Time Last Known Well was 3300. No other documentation in the medical record provides a valid time. Since the time last known well is outside of the range listed in the Allowable Values for "Hour," it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select "UTD."

Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid time as described above will be rejected from the Joint Commission's Data Warehouse. Use of "UTD" for Time Last Known Well allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.
If the Time Last Known Well is documented as one specific time and entered as Time Last Known Well on a “Code Stroke” form or stroke-specific electronic template, enter that time as the Time Last Known Well. Documentation of Time Last Known Well on a
stroke-specific form or template should be selected regardless of other times last known well documented elsewhere in the medical record. 
Exceptions:
ANY physician/APN/PA documentation that Last Known Well /onset of signs/symptoms is unknown/uncertain/unclear takes precedence over specific time on “Code Stroke” form.
Crossing out of a specific time on a Code Stroke Form and a specific time documented on the same or different Code Stroke Form, use the specific time that is not crossed out.
A specific time on a Code Stroke Form and another time reference documented, e.g. <8 hours, on the same or different Code Stroke Forms, use the specific time.
Multiple specific times on the same or different Code Stroke Forms, use abstraction guidelines for multiple Times Last Known Well.
Unable to determine if a form is a Code Stroke Form, continue to review the medical record for Time Last Known Well documentation in other sources.
A Code Stroke Form is used by the stroke team or ED staff to document the acute stroke process.
See the inclusion list for acceptable terms used for a Code Stroke Form. The list is not all-inclusive.
Time Last Known Well on a Code Stroke Form may be documented by a nurse.
If the time last known well is documented as being a specific number of hours prior to arrival (e.g., felt left side go numb 2 hours ago) rather than a specific time, subtract that number from the time of ED arrival and enter that time as the time last known well.
If the time last known well is noted to be a range of time prior to ED arrival (e.g., felt left side go numb 2 - 3 hours ago), assume the maximum time from the range (e.g., 3 hours), and subtract that number of hours from the time of arrival to compute the time last known well.
If the time is noted to be “less than” a period of time prior to ED arrival, assume the maximum range.
Example:
Time Last Known Well less than one hour ago. Subtract one hour from the time of arrival to compute time last known well.
If both the time last known well and the time of symptom onset are documented, select the Time Last Known Well. 
Examples:
H&P states, "Patient watching TV with family and complained of blurred vision in both eyes at 8:30 PM." ED MD notes, "Patient normal at 8:30 PM." Time Last Known Well is 2030.
"Patient was doing well at 4:30 PM -- noticed difficulty speaking around 6 PM." Time Last Known Well is 1630.
Patient normal at 2200 before going to bed. Awoke at 0200 with headache and took two aspirin before returning to sleep. OK at 0700 and went to work. Felt confused, unable to speak without slurring at 0800. Time Last Known Well is 0700.
If the only time documented is time of symptom onset without mention of when the patient was last known well, use the time of symptom onset for time last known well.
Example:
"Sudden onset headache one hour before ED arrival," documented by EDMD. Arrival time 19:24. No other documentation referencing time last known well available in medical record. Time Last Known Well 18:24.
If there are multiple times of last known well documented in the absence of the Time Last Known Well explicitly documented on a "Code Stroke" form, use physician documentation first before other sources, e.g., nursing, EMS.
Example:
"Patient last seen normal this morning at 1000" per H&P. ED nurse documented 09:50 as time last well. Time Last Known Well is 1000.
If multiple times of last known well are documented by different physicians or by the same provider, user the earliest time recorded
If there is documentation of one or more episodes of stroke symptoms AND documentation of symptom resolution between episodes, use the time of the most recent (last) episode prior to arrival, regardless if all symptoms resolved prior to arrival.
Examples:
"Patient reported right hand paresthesia two days ago that resolved spontaneously after a few minutes. New onset of symptoms today around 0700 involving right arm and right leg." Time Last Known Well is 0700.
"Wife states that he was having trouble with slurred speech and confusion yesterday. Symptom free this morning. Return of symptoms with facial droop noted around noon." Time Last Known Well is 1200.
"Wife noticed slurred speech at 8:30 last night. Without symptoms early this morning. Wife noticed slurred speech again at 0900 during breakfast conversation." Time Last Known Well is 0900.
"Wife noticed slurred speech at 8:30 last night. Symptom-free this morning. Came to ED to get checked out." Time Last Known Well is 2030.

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS & COMPREHENSIVE: When is the earliest physician/APN/PA documentation of comfort measures only?

NOTE: Determination of hospital day in this question differs from the rest of the PMT

Indicate if there is any evidence that the patient's care was restricted to "Comfort Measures Only" prior to the end of hospital day 2.

Day 0 or 1
Day 2 or after
Timing unclear
Not Documented/UTD
Comfort Measures Only refers to medical treatment of a dying person where the natural dying process is permitted to occur while assuring maximum comfort. It includes attention to the psychological and spiritual needs of the patient and support for both the dying patient and the patient's family. Comfort Measures Only is commonly referred to as “comfort care” by the general public. It is not equivalent to a physician order to withhold emergency resuscitative measures such as Do Not Resuscitate (DNR).

Day 0 or 1: The earliest day the physician/APN/PA documented comfort measures only was the day of arrival (Day 0) or day after arrival (Day 1).
Day 2 or after: The earliest day the physician/APN/PA documented comfort measures only was two or more days after arrival day (Day 2+).
Timing unclear: There is physician/APN/PA documentation of comfort measures only during this hospital stay, but whether the earliest documentation of comfort measures only was on day 0 or 1 OR after day 1 is unclear.
Not Documented/UTD: There is no physician/APN/PA documentation of comfort measures only, or unable to determine from medical record documentation.
Notes for Abstraction:

Only accept terms identified in the list of inclusions. No other terminology will be accepted.
Physician/APN/PA documentation of comfort measures only (hospice, comfort care, etc.) mentioned in the following contexts suffices:
Comfort measures only recommendation
Order for consultation or evaluation by a hospice care service
Patient or family request for comfort measures only
Plan for comfort measures only
Referral to hospice care service
Discussion of comfort measures
Determine the earliest day comfort measures only (CMO) was DOCUMENTED by the physician/APN/PA. If any of the inclusion terms are documented by the physician/APN/PA, select value "1," "2," or "3" accordingly.
Example:
"Discussed comfort care with family on arrival" noted in day 2 progress note -- Select "2."
State-authorized portable orders (SAPOs):
SAPOs are specialized forms or identifiers authorized by state law that translate a patient�€™s preferences about specific end-of-life treatment decisions into portable medical orders. 
Examples:
DNR-Comfort Care form
MOLST (Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment)
POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment)
Out-of-Hospital DNR (OOH DNR)
If there is a SAPO in the record that is dated and signed prior to arrival with an option in which an inclusion term is found that is checked, select value "1."
If a SAPO lists different options for CMO and any CMO option is checked, select value "1," "2," or "3" as applicable.
If one or more dated SAPOs are included in the record (and signed by the physician/APN/PA), use only the most recent one. Disregard undated SAPOs.
For cases where there is a SAPO in the record with a CMO option selected: If the SAPO is dated prior to arrival and there is documentation on the day of arrival or the day after arrival that the patient does not want CMO, and there is no other documentation regarding CMO found in the record, disregard the SAPO.
Example:
Patient has a POLST dated prior to arrival in his chart and ED physician states in current record "Patient is refusing comfort measures, wants to receive full treatment and be a full code."
Documentation of an inclusion term in the following situations should be disregarded. Continue to review the remaining physician/APN/PA documentation for acceptable inclusion terms. If the ONLY documentation found is an inclusion term in the following situations, select value "4."
Documentation (other than SAPOs) that is dated prior to arrival or documentation which refers to the pre-arrival time period.
Examples:
Comfort measures only order in previous hospitalization record.
"Pt. on hospice at home" in MD ED note.
Inclusion term clearly described as negative or conditional. 
Examples:
"No comfort care"
"Not appropriate for hospice care"
"Comfort care would also be reasonable - defer decision for now"
"DNRCCA" (Do Not Resuscitate -- Comfort Care Arrest)
"Family requests comfort measures only should the patient arrest."
Documentation of "CMO" should be disregarded if documentation makes clear it is not being used as an acronym for Comfort Measures Only (e.g., "hx dilated CMO" -- Cardiomyopathy context).
If there is physician/APN/PA documentation of an inclusion term in one source that indicates the patient is Comfort Measures Only, AND there is physician/APN/PA documentation of an inclusion term in another source that indicates the patient is NOT CMO, the source that indicates the patient is CMO would be used to select value "1," "2," or "3" for this data element.
Examples:
Physician documents in progress note on day 1 "The patient has refused Comfort Measures" AND then on day 2 the physician writes an order for a Hospice referral. Select value "2."
ED physician documents in a note on day of arrival "Patient states they want to be enrolled in Hospice" AND then on day 2 there is a physician progress note with documentation of "Patient is not a Hospice candidate." Select value "1."

N (No) There is no documentation on the day of or day after hospital arrival of a reason for extending the initiation of IV thrombolytic to 3 to 4.5 hours of Time Last Known Well, OR unable to determine from the medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

Documentation of a reason for extending the initiation of IV thrombolytic to 3 to 4.5 hours must be done on the day of or the day after hospital arrival and must refer to the time period prior to IV thrombolytic initiation. It is not necessary to review documentation outside of this timeframe to answer this data element.
"Other" reasons for extending the initiation of IV thrombolytic therapy to 3 to 4.5 hours must be documented by a physician/APN/PA or pharmacist.
EXCEPTION:
Nursing documentation of a telemedicine/teleneurology reason for extending the initiation of IV thrombolytic therapy to 3 to 4.5 hours is acceptable.
The following are acceptable as stand-alone reasons for extending the initiation of IV thrombolytics -- IV thrombolytic therapy linkage is not needed:

Early Antithrombotics

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: Was antithrombotic therapy administered by the end of hospital day 2?

Documentation that antithrombotic therapy was administered by the end of hospital day 2. Antithrombotics include both anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs.

Y (Yes) Antithrombotic therapy was administered by the end of hospital day 2.

N (No) Antithrombotic therapy was not administered by the end of hospital day 2, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

To compute end of hospital day 2, count the arrival date as hospital day 1. If antithrombotic therapy was administered by 11:59 P.M of hospital day two, answer "Yes" for this data element. Documentation of antithrombotic administration must be found within the timeframe of arrival to the end of hospital day 2. It is not necessary to review documentation outside of this timeframe to answer this data element.
For antithrombotic therapy administered in the Emergency Department/observation area prior to the end of hospital day 2, select "Yes."
Antithrombotic therapy administration information must demonstrate actual administration of the medication.
Example: Do not use physician orders as they do not demonstrate administration of the antithrombotic therapy (in the ED this may be used if signed/initialed by a nurse).
When antithrombotic is noted as a "home" or "current" medication or documentation indicates that it was received prior to hospital arrival only, select "No".
Lovenox SQ for VTE prophylaxis (i.e. enoxaparin SQ 40 mg once daily; enoxaparin SQ 30 mg Q12 hours) is not sufficient. If no other antithrombotic therapy is administered by the end of hospital day 2, select “No.”

Y (Yes) There is physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a reason for not administering antithrombotic therapy by end of hospital day 2.

N (No) There is no physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a reason for not administering antithrombotic therapy by end of hospital day 2 or unable to determine from the medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

Documentation for allowable value "Yes" must be found within the timeframe of arrival to the end of hospital day 2. It is not necessary to review documentation outside of this timeframe to answer this data element.
To compute end of hospital day 2, count the arrival date as hospital day 1. If a reason for not administering antithrombotic therapy was documented by 11:59 P.M of hospital day 2, select "Yes" for this data element.
Reasons for not administering antithrombotic therapy must be documented by a
physician/APN/PA or pharmacist with one exception: Patient/family refusal of any form of
antithrombotic therapy (e.g., “ASA refused”, “Patient refusing antithrombotic therapy”) may
be documented by a nurse. However, it must be documented in the timeframe of arrival to
the end of hospital day 2.
Example: Patient arrived on 03/01/XX. Nursing notes on 03/02/20XX indicates that patient
refused antithrombotic therapy, select “YES”.
If reasons are not mentioned in the context of antithrombotics, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that antithrombotic therapy was not administered because of a bleeding disorder unless documentation explicitly states so).
Reasons must be explicitly documented (e.g., “Hemorrhagic transformation – do not give aspirin”, “Active GI bleed – antithrombotic therapy contraindicated”, “H/O bleeding disorder – anticoagulation therapy contraindicated”, “Low platelet count - do not give antiplatelet medications”, “No ASA” [no reason given]).
Consider the terms “anticoagulant”, “antiplatelet”, and “blood thinners” synonymous with antithrombotic therapy. Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation, (e.g., “no blood thinners”, “no anticoagulant medications”, “no antiplatelet medications”), select “Yes”
Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a hold on an antithrombotic medication or discontinuation of an antithrombotic medication that occurs the day of or day after hospital arrival constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not
administering antithrombotic therapy by end of hospital day 2. A hold/discontinuation of all P.O. medications counts if an antithrombotic was on order at the time of the notation.
NPO is NOT a reason for not administering antithrombotic therapy without explicit documentation that no antithrombotic medication should be given. Another route of administration can be used.
An allergy or adverse reaction to one type of antithrombotic would NOT be a reason for not administering all antithrombotics. Another medication can be ordered.
For patients on warfarin therapy prior to hospital arrival, but placed on hold the day of or after arrival due to “high INR”, select “Yes”.

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: Was the LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) measured within the first 48 hours or 30 days prior to hospital arrival?

LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) measurement obtained within the first 48 hours or 30 days prior to hospital arrival . Lipid levels drawn in the first 48 hours after a major vascular event are reliable predictors of baseline lipid profiles, but after that time may become unreliable.

Y (Yes) LDL-c was measured within the first 48 hours or 30 days prior to hospital arrival.

N (No) LDL-c was not measured within the first 48 hours or 30 days prior to hospital arrival, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation (e.g., LDL-c testing was done within 48 hours but no values are available).

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: Was the patient's highest LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) level greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL in the first 48 hours or within 30 days prior to hospital arrival?

Value of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) was greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL. LDL is a complex of lipids and proteins, with greater amounts of lipid than protein that transports cholesterol in the blood. High levels are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.

Y (Yes) LDL-c greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL in the first 48 hours or within 30 days prior to hospital arrival.

N (No) LDL-c less than 100 mg/dL in the first 48 hours or within 30 days prior to hospital arrival , OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

For this measurement, look for the highest level from testing done in the first 48 hours after hospital arrival or within 30 days prior to hospital arrival.
Direct and calculated (indirect) LDL-c values are both acceptable.
Fasting and non-fasting LDL-c values are both acceptable.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at "face value"). When the LDL-c value documented is obviously in error (not a valid number) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select "No."
If all LDL-c value(s) from testing done within the first 48 hours after hospital arrival or within 30 days prior to hospital arrival are reported as not calculated (e.g., high triglycerides render the LDL-c calculation inaccurate), select “No”.
If an LDL-c value on the laboratory report conflicts with that from another source of documentation for the same specimen, use the value from the laboratory report.
If a laboratory report documents discrepant LDL-c values for the same specimen, use the highest value.
If sources other than a laboratory report document discrepant LDL-c values for the same specimen, use the highest value.
Disregard LDL-c values reported in units of mmol/L or any other unit of measurement other than mg/dL or mg/100 ml. If the unit of measurement is not documented, assume the unit of measurement is mg/dL.

Discharge Information

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS & COMPREHENSIVE: Discharge Date/Time

The month, day, year, and time the patient was discharged from acute care, left against medical advice, or expired during this stay.

MM = Month (01-12)
DD = Day (01-31)
YYYY = Year (20XX)
HH = Hour (00-23)
MM = Minutes (00-59)
UTD = Unable to Determine
Note: The CMS Clinical Warehouse only allows data containing dates applicable to a specified quarter of data transmission. Data submitted for discharge quarters outside of the current submission deadline will be rejected.
Refer to the Data Transmission section of this manual for further guidance related to data transmission.

Notes for Abstraction:

Because this data element is critical in determining the population for many measures, the abstractor should NOT assume that the claim information for the discharge date is correct. If the abstractor determines through chart review that the date is incorrect, she/he should correct and override the downloaded value. If the abstractor is unable to determine the correct discharge date through chart review, she/he should default to the discharge date on the claim information.
For times that include seconds, remove the seconds and record the military time. Example: 15:00:35 would be recorded as 15:00.
For patients who expire during the hospital stay, the time that the patient was pronounced / time of death should be used for the discharge time.
If the patient was transferred, use the time the patient was actually transferred to another facility, not the time the order was written.
If there are multiple times documented, use the latest time. The administrative time of discharge is acceptable if there is no documentation of a later time of discharge present in the medical record.
If the time of discharge is unable to be determined from medical record documentation, select UTD.
The medical record must be abstracted as documented (taken at face value). When the time documented is obviously in error (not a valid format/range) and no other documentation is found that provides this information, the abstractor should select UTD.
Example:
Documentation indicates the Discharge Time was 3300. No other documentation in the list of ONLY ACCEPTABLE SOURCES provides a valid time. Since the Discharge Time is outside of the range in the Allowable Values for Hour, it is not a valid time and the abstractor should select UTD.
Note: Transmission of a case with an invalid time as described above will be rejected from the CMS Clinical Warehouse and the Joint Commissions Data Warehouse. Use of UTD for Discharge Time allows the case to be accepted into the warehouse.

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: Was antithrombotic therapy prescribed at hospital discharge?

Documentation that antithrombotic therapy was prescribed at hospital discharge. Antithrombotics include both anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs.

Y (Yes) Antithrombotic therapy was prescribed at hospital discharge.

N (No) Antithrombotic therapy was not prescribed at hospital discharge, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

In determining whether antithrombotic therapy was prescribed at discharge, it is not uncommon to see conflicting documentation amongst different medical record sources. For example, the discharge summary may list an antithrombotic that is not included in any of the other discharge medication sources (e.g., discharge orders). All discharge medication documentation available in the chart should be reviewed and taken into account by the abstractor.
In cases where there is an antithrombotic in one source that is not mentioned in other sources, it should be interpreted as a discharge medication (select "Yes") unless documentation elsewhere in the medical record suggests that it was NOT prescribed at discharge - Consider it a discharge medication in the absence of contradictory documentation.
If documentation is contradictory (e.g., physician noted "d/c Plavix" in the discharge orders, but Plavix is listed in the discharge summary's discharge medication list), or after careful examination of circumstances, context, timing, etc., documentation raises enough questions, the case should be deemed "unable to determine" (select "No").
Consider documentation of a hold on an antithrombotic after discharge in one location and a listing of that antithrombotic as a discharge medication in another location as contradictory ONLY if the timeframe on the hold is not defined (e.g., “Hold Plavix”). Examples of a hold with a defined timeframe include “Hold Plavix x2 days” and “Hold ASA until after stress test.”
If an antithrombotic is NOT listed as a discharge medication, and there is only documentation of a hold or plan to delay initiation/restarting of antithrombotic therapy after discharge (e.g., “Hold Plavix x2 days,” “Start Plavix as outpatient,” “Hold Plavix”), select “No”.
If two discharge summaries are included in the medical record, use the one with the latest date/time. If one or both are not dated or timed, and you cannot determine which was done last, use both. This also applies to discharge medication reconciliation forms. Use the dictated date/time over transcribed date/time, file date/time, etc.
Examples:
Two discharge summaries, one dictated 5/22 (day of discharge) and one dictated 5/27 - Use the 5/27 discharge summary.
Two discharge medication reconciliation forms, one not dated and one dated 4/24 (day of discharge) - Use both.
Disregard an antithrombotic medication documented only as a recommended medication for discharge (e.g., “Recommend sending patient home on aspirin”). Documentation must be more clear that an antithrombotic was actually prescribed at discharge.
Disregard documentation of antithrombotic prescribed at discharge when noted only by medication class (e.g., “Antithrombotic Prescribed at Discharge: Yes” on a core measures form). The antithrombotic must be listed by name.

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: Is there documentation by a physician/advanced practice nurse/physician assistant (physician/APN/PA) or pharmacist in the medical record of a reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at hospital discharge?

Reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at hospital discharge.

Other reason documented by physician/APN/PA or pharmacist
Antithrombotic therapy is administered to reduce morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rate in stroke .

Y (Yes) There is documentation of a reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at hospital discharge.

N (No) There is no documentation of a reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at hospital discharge, OR unable to determine from the medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

Reasons for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at hospital discharge must be documented by a physician/APN/PA or pharmacist with one exception: Patient/family refusal of any form of antithrombotic therapy (e.g., “ASA refused,” “Patient refusing antithrombotic therapy”) may be documented by a nurse.
If reasons are not mentioned in the context of antithrombotics, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that antithrombotic therapy was not prescribed because of a bleeding disorder unless documentation explicitly states so).
Reasons must be explicitly documented (e.g., Active GI bleed – antithrombotic therapy contraindicated”, “H/O bleeding disorder – anticoagulation therapy contraindicated”, “Low platelet count - do not give antiplatelet medications”,“No ASA” [no reason given]).
Consider the terms “anticoagulant”, “antiplatelet”, and “blood thinners” synonymous with antithrombotic therapy. Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation, (e.g., “no blood thinners”, “no anticoagulant medications”, “no antiplatelet medications”), select “Yes”
Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a hold on an antithrombotic medication or discontinuation of an antithrombotic medication that occurs during the hospital stay constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at discharge. A hold/discontinuation of all p.o. medications counts if an oral antithrombotic medication (e.g., Plavix) was on order at the time of the notation.
EXCEPTIONS:
Documentation of a conditional hold or discontinuation of an antithrombotic medication does not count as a reason for not prescribing an antithrombotic medication at discharge (e.g., “Hold ASA if guaiac positive”, “Stop Plavix if rash persists", “No ASA for 24 hours following thrombolytic therapy”).
Discontinuation of a particular antithrombotic medication documented in combination with the start of a different antithrombotic medication (i.e., switch type of antithrombotic medication) does not count as a reason for not prescribing an antithrombotic medication at discharge.
Examples:
“Stop Plavix” and “Start Plavix 75 mg po daily” in same physician order
“Change Plavix to aspirin” in progress note
“Do not continue after discharge” checked for Plavix and “Continue after discharge” checked for clopidogrel on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Discontinuation of an antithrombotic medication at a particular dose documented in combination with the start of a different dose of that antithrombotic (i.e., change in dosage) does not count as a reason for not prescribing an antithrombotic medication at discharge.
Examples:
“Stop Ecotrine 300 mg po daily” and “Start Ecotrin 325 mg po daily” in same physician order
“Increase Ecotrin 81 mg to 325 mg daily” in progress note
“Do not continue after discharge” checked for Ecotrin 300 mg and “Continue after discharge” checked for Ecotrin 325 mg on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Deferral of antithrombotic therapy from one physician/APN/PA or pharmacist to another does NOT count as a reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at discharge unless the problem underlying the deferral is also noted.
Examples:
“Consulting neurologist to evaluate pt. for warfarin therapy.” - select “No”.
“Rule out GI bleed. Start ASA if OK with gastroenterology.” - select “Yes”.
If there is documentation of a plan to initiate/restart antithrombotic therapy, and the reason/problem underlying the delay in starting/restarting antithrombotic therapy is also noted, this constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at discharge.
Acceptable examples (select “Yes”):
“Stool Occult Blood positive. May start Coumadin as outpatient.”
“Start ASA if hematuria subsides.”
Unacceptable examples (select “No”):
“Consider starting Coumadin in a.m.”
“May add Plavix when pt. can tolerate”
Reasons do NOT need to be documented at discharge or otherwise linked to the discharge timeframe: Documentation of reasons anytime during the hospital stay are acceptable (e.g., mid-hospitalization note stating “no ASA due to rectal bleeding” - select “Yes,” even if documentation indicates that the rectal bleeding has resolved by the time of discharge and ASA was restarted).
Crossing out of an antithrombotic medication counts as a "clearly implied reason" for not prescribing antithrombotic therapy at discharge only if on a pre-printed form.
An allergy or adverse reaction to one type of antithrombotic would NOT be a reason for not administering all antithrombotics. Another medication can be ordered.
When conflicting information is documented in a medical record, select “Yes”.
When the current record includes documentation of a pre-arrival reason for no antithrombotic threrapy, the following counts regardless of whether this documentation is included in a pre-arrival record made part of the current record or whether it is noted by hospital staff during the current hospital stay:
Pre-arrival hold/discontinuation or notation such as "No Coumadin" IF the underlying reason/problem is also noted (e.g., “Coumadin held in transferring hospital due to possible GI bleed”).
Pre-arrival "other reason" (other than hold/discontinuation or notation of "No ASA") (e.g., "Hx GI bleeding with ASA" in transferring ED record).
Suggested Data Sources:

ONLY PHYSICIAN/APN/PA OR PHARMACIST DOCUMENTATION OF A REASON FOR NOT PRESCRIBING ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY AT HOSPITAL DISCHARGE:

Consultation notes
Discharge summary

Refer to Appendix C, Table 8.2 for a comprehensive list of Antithrombotic Medications

Antithrombotic medication allergy described using one of the negative modifiers or qualifiers listed in Appendix H, Table 2.6, Qualifiers and Modifiers Table.

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: Was anticoagulation therapy prescribed at hospital discharge?

Note for Stroke Core Measures/TJC users: This field will be auto-populated based on data entry made to the element If atrial fib/flutter or history of PAF documented, was patient discharged on anticoagulation? located on the Discharge Tab.

Abstractors should verify that the anticoagulant medication prescribed is acceptable for TJC/CMS stroke core measures by checking Appendix C Table 8.3 in the most current specifications manual. If the medication administered does not appear in Table 8.3, you must change the autopopulated response in order to be compliant with TJC/CMS standards.

Documentation that anticoagulation therapy was prescribed at hospital discharge. Anticoagulant medications prevent the clotting of blood.

Y (Yes) Anticoagulation therapy was prescribed at hospital discharge

N (No) Anticoagulation therapy was not prescribed at hospital discharge, OR unable to determine from the medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

In determining whether anticoagulation therapy was prescribed at discharge, it is not uncommon to see conflicting documentation amongst different medical record sources. For example, the discharge summary may list an anticoagulant that is not included in any of the other discharge medication sources (e.g., discharge orders). All discharge medication documentation available in the chart should be reviewed and taken into account by the abstractor.
In cases where there is an anticoagulant in one source that is not mentioned in other sources, it should be interpreted as a discharge medication (select "Yes") unless documentation elsewhere in the medical record suggests that it was NOT prescribed at discharge - Consider it a discharge medication in the absence of contradictory documentation.
If documentation is contradictory (e.g., physician noted "d/c Coumadin" or "hold Coumadin" in the discharge orders, but Coumadin is listed in the discharge summary's discharge medication list), or after careful examination of circumstances, context, timing, etc., documentation raises enough questions, the case should be deemed "unable to determine" (select "No").
Consider documentation of a hold on an anticoagulant after discharge in one location and a listing of that anticoagulant as a discharge medication in another location as contradictory ONLY if the timeframe on the hold is not defined (e.g., “Hold Coumadin”). Examples of a hold with a defined timeframe include “Hold Coumadin x2 days” and “Hold warfarin until after stress test.”
If an anticoagulant is NOT listed as a discharge medication, and there is only documentation of a hold or plan to delay initiation/restarting of anticoagulation therapy after discharge (e.g., “Hold Coumadin x2 days,” “Start Coumadin as outpatient,” “Hold Coumadin”), select “No”.
If two discharge summaries are included in the medical record, use the one with the latest date/time. If one or both are not dated or timed, and you cannot determine which was done last, use both. This also applies to discharge medication reconciliation forms. Use the dictated date/time over transcribed date/time, file date/time, etc.
Examples:
Two discharge summaries, one dictated 5/22 (day of discharge) and one dictated 5/27 - Use the 5/27 discharge summary.
Two discharge medication reconciliation forms, one not dated and one dated 4/24 (day of discharge) - Use both.
Disregard an anticoagulant medication documented only as a recommended medication for discharge (e.g., “Recommend sending patient home on dabigatran”). Documentation must be more clear that an anticoagulant was actually prescribed at discharge.
Disregard documentation of anticoagulant prescribed at discharge when noted only by medication class (e.g., “Anticoagulant Prescribed at Discharge: Yes” on a core measures form). The anticoagulant must be listed by name.

Inclusion Guidelines for Abstraction:
Refer to Appendix C, Table 8.3 for a list of medications used for anticoagulation therapy.
Exclusion Guidelines for Abstraction:


• Heparin SQ
• Heparin Flush
• Hep-Lock

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: Is there documentation by a physician/advanced practice nurse/physician assistant (physician/APN/PA) or pharmacist in the medical record of a reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge?

Note for Stroke Core Measures/TJC users: This field will be auto-populated based on data entry made to the element If atrial fib/flutter or history of PAF documented, was patient discharged on anticoagulation? located on the Discharge Tab.

Reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge.

Other reason documented by physician/APN/PA or pharmacist
The administration of anticoagulation therapy, unless there are contraindications, is an established effective strategy in preventing recurrent stroke in high stroke risk-atrial fibrillation patients with TIA or prior stroke.

Y (Yes) There is documentation of a reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge.

N (No) There is no documentation of a reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge, OR unable to determine from the medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

Reasons for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge must be documented by a physician/APN/PA or pharmacist with one exception: Patient/family refusal of any form of anticoagulation therapy (e.g., “Coumadin refused,” “Patient refusing anticoagulation therapy”) may be documented by a nurse.
If reasons are not mentioned in the context of anticoagulation therapy, do not make inferences (e.g., do not assume that anticoagulation therapy was not prescribed because of a bleeding disorder unless documentation explicitly states so).
Reasons must be explicitly documented (e.g., “Active GI bleed – anticoagulation therapy contraindicated”, “No warfarin” [no reason given].).
Consider the term “blood thinners” synonymous with anticoagulant therapy. Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation, e.g., “no blood thinners”, select “Yes”.
Physician/APN/PA or pharmacist documentation of a hold on an anticoagulant medication or discontinuation of an anticoagulant medication that occurs during the hospital stay constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at discharge. A hold/discontinuation of all p.o. medications counts if an oral anticoagulant medication (e.g., warfarin) was on order at the time of the notation.
EXCEPTIONS:
Documentation of a conditional hold or discontinuation of an anticoagulant medication does not count as a reason for not prescribing an anticoagulant medication at discharge (e.g., “Hold Coumadin if guaiac positive”, “Stop warfarin if rash persists”, “No warfarin for 24 hours following thrombolytic therapy”).
Discontinuation of a particular anticoagulant medication documented in combination with the start of a different anticoagulant medication (i.e., switch type of anticoagulant medication) does not count as a reason for not prescribing an anticoagulant medication at discharge.
Examples:
“Stop warfarin” and “Start warfarin 2 mg po daily” in same physician order
“Change Coumadin to Pradaxa” in progress note
“Do not continue after discharge” checked for warfarin and “Continue after discharge” checked for Coumadin on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Discontinuation of an anticoagulant medication at a particular dose documented in combination with the start of a different dose of that anticoagulant (i.e., change in dosage) does not count as a reason for not prescribing an anticoagulant medication at discharge.
Examples:
“Stop warfarin 5 mg po daily” and “Start warfarin 2.5 mg po daily” in same physician order
“Decrease dabigatran 150 mg po BID to 75 mg po BID” in progress note
“Do not continue after discharge” checked for Coumadin 5 mg and “Continue after discharge” check for Coumadin 2.5 mg on a physician-signed discharge medication reconciliation form
Deferral of anticoagulation therapy from one physician/APN/PA or pharmacist to another does NOT count as a reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at discharge unless the problem underlying the deferral is also noted.
Examples:
“Consulting neurologist to evaluate pt. for warfarin therapy.” - select “No”.
“Rule out GI bleed. Start Coumadin if OK with gastroenterology.” - select "Yes”.
If there is documentation of a plan to initiate/restart anticoagulation therapy, and the reason/problem underlying the delay in starting/restarting anticoagulation therapy is also noted, this constitutes a “clearly implied” reason for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at discharge.
Acceptable examples (select “Yes”):
“Stool Occult Blood positive. May start Coumadin as outpatient.”
“Start warfarin if hematuria subsides.”
Unacceptable examples (select “No”):
“Consider starting Coumadin in a.m.”
“May add warfarin when pt. can tolerate”
Reasons do NOT need to be documented at discharge or otherwise linked to the discharge timeframe: Documentation of reasons anytime during the hospital stay are acceptable (e.g., mid-hospitalization note stating “no warfarin due to rectal bleeding” - select “Yes,” even if documentation indicates that the rectal bleeding has resolved by the time of discharge and warfarin was restarted).
Crossing out of an anticoagulant medication counts as a "clearly implied reason" for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy at discharge only if on a pre-printed form.
An allergy or adverse reaction to one type of anticoagulant would NOT be a reason for not administering all anticoagulants. Another medication can be ordered.
When conflicting information is documented in a medical record, select “Yes”.
When the current record includes documentation of a pre-arrival reason for no anticoagulation threrapy, the following counts regardless of whether this documentation is included in a pre-arrival record made part of the current record or whether it is noted by hospital staff during the current hospital stay:
Pre-arrival hold/discontinuation or notation such as "No Coumadin" IF the underlying reason/problem is also noted (e.g., “Coumadin held in transferring hospital due to possible GI bleed”).
Pre-arrival "other reason" (other than hold/discontinuation or notation of "No warfarin") (e.g., "Hx GI bleeding with warfarin" in transferring ED record).
See the inclusion list for acceptable reasons for not prescribing anticoagulation therapy. The list is not all-inclusive.
An allergy or adverse reaction to one type of anticoagulant would NOT be a reason for not administering all anticoagulants. Another medication can be ordered.

REQUIRED FOR TJC/CMS: Was a statin medication prescribed at discharge?

Documentation that a statin medication was prescribed at hospital discharge. Statins are a class of pharmaceutical agents that modify LDL cholesterol by blocking the action of an enzyme in the liver which is needed to synthesize cholesterol thereby decreasing the level of cholesterol circulating in the blood.

Y (Yes) Statin medication prescribed at discharge.

N (No) Statin medication not prescribed at discharge, OR unable to determine from medical record documentation.

Notes for Abstraction:

In determining whether a statin medication was prescribed at discharge, it is not uncommon to see conflicting documentation amongst different medical record sources. For example, the discharge summary may list a statin medication that is not included in any of the other discharge medication sources (e.g., discharge orders). All discharge medication documentation available in the chart should be reviewed and taken into account by the abstractor.
In cases where there is a statin medication in one source that is not mentioned in other sources, it should be interpreted as a discharge medication (select "Yes") unless documentation elsewhere in the medical record suggests that it was NOT prescribed at discharge - Consider it a discharge medication in the absence of contradictory documentation.
If documentation is contradictory (e.g., physician noted "d/c lovastatin " in the discharge orders, but lovastatin is listed in the discharge summary's discharge medication list), or, after careful examination of circumstances, context, timing, etc, documentation raises enough questions, the case should be deemed "unable to determine" (select "No").
Consider documentation of a hold on a statin medication after discharge in one location and a listing of that statin medication as a discharge medication in another location as contradictory ONLY if the timeframe on the hold is not defined (e.g., “Hold lovastatin”). Examples of a hold with a defined timeframe include “Hold Vytorin x2 days” and “Hold lovastatin until ALT/AST normalize.”
If a statin medication is NOT listed as a discharge medication, and there is only documentation of a hold or plan to delay initiation/restarting of a statin medication after discharge (e.g., “Hold Vytorin x2 days,” “Start statins as outpatient,” “Hold lovastatin”), select “No”.
If two discharge summaries are included in the medical record, use the one with the latest date/time. If one or both are not dated or timed, and you cannot determine which was done last, use both.

Stroke Core Measure Additional Comments

PSC Optional Fields

These fields have been added to aid in the documentation needs for TJC Primary Stroke Center Certification. Documenting this information here within the Patient Management Tool is optional, but may be helpful if another system of documentation is not already being used in your hospital to keep track of this information. The following notes were taken from The Joint Commission's 2008 Disease-Specific Care Certification Manual: Disease-Specific Care Certification Requirements for Primary Stroke Center.

Date/Time Stroke Team Activated
Date/Time Stroke Team Arrived
N/A

Requirements Specific to Primary Stroke Center Certification

Standard PR.8, EP 1a

Physicians on the acute stroke team have knowledge and expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease.

Standard PR.8, EP 5a

Written documentation exists for stroke team notification system and expected response times.

Optimally, a care provider experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke will be available within 15 minutes by telephone and at the bedside (as per a referring physician's request) of an acute stroke patient within the time period designated in the protocol and/or as instructed by the stroke center director. Response time adherence may also be accomplished through telemedicine and/or with a resident or other care provider in contact with an experienced stroke care provider within the time designated by the protocol.

Standard CT.2, EP 3

Evidence of stroke team log that captures stroke team response time to acute stroke patients, treatment used, and patient disposition. The log can be captured by written or electronic means and/or may be done retrospectively through medical record audits.

 
Date/Time Neurosurgical Services Consulted
N/A

Requirements Specific to Primary Stroke Center Certification

Standard PR.8, EP 1b

Written documentation shows evidence of neurosurgical coverage or protocol for transfer to an appropriate facility.

Standard PR.8, EP 1c

For sites that do not transfer patients for neurosurgical emergencies, the stroke center has a fully functional operating room (OR) facility and staff for neurosurgical services within two hours of the recognized need for such services.

Date/Time Brain Imaging Ordered
Date/Time Brain Imaging Reported
N/A

Requirements Specific to Primary Stroke Center Certification

Standard PR.8, EP 1d

Documentation indicates that on a 24/7 basis, 80% of acute stroke patients have a diagnostic brain image completed (and results reported to or reviewed by a member of the stroke team) within 45 minutes of it being ordered, when clinically indicated (in acute hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke resuscitation candidates).

The brain image can be obtained by CT or MRI and needs to definitively rule out/detect intra-cranial hemorrhage, or other causes of the stroke syndrome. The imaging needs to be available on site 24 hours a day/365 days a year (barring short term failure, whereby the hospital should divert potential acute stroke patients). However, review of the images does not have to be done on site. Evaluation can be performed off site by telemedicine technology.

Date/Time Lab tests Ordered
Date/Time Lab tests Completed
N/A

Requirements Specific to Primary Stroke Center Certification

Standard PR.8, EP 1e

Documentation indicates the ability to complete initial lab tests and availability on site 24/7.

Lab tests include a complete blood cell count with platelet count, coagulation studies, (PT, INR), and blood chemistries.

Standard PR.8, EP 1f

Documentation indicates the ability to complete and report lab tests in less than 45 minutes from being ordered.


Date/Time ECG Ordered
Date/Time ECG Completed
N/A

Date/Time Chest x-ray Ordered
Date/Time Chest x-ray Completed
N/A

Requirements Specific to Primary Stroke Center Certification

Standard PR.8, EP 1g

Table 5. Anticoagulant Medications

Please see specific dosing information within the coding instructions to determine if anticoagulant dosing is sufficient to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA.  If dosing is not appropriate as antithrombotic therapy, and that is the only antithrombotic medication that the patient has received, you should select “No” to the antithrombotic medication data elements of: “Was antithrombotic therapy administered by the end of hospital day 2” and “Antithrombotic Medication(s) at Discharge” on the Hospitalization and Discharge Tabs.

For Stroke Core Measure/TJC Users: respond to the Core Measures tab data elements by verifying that the medication is acceptable.  You would do this by checking the most current Specifications Manual.  You may need to change the auto-populated response on the Core Measures tab to meet those specifications.

This documentation needs to be made prior to patient discharge. For example the neurologist who was called by telephone puts a note in the medical record the next day which documents the reason for non-treatment. 
Replaced it with: It is permissible to abstract reasons for non-treatment from the medical record that are entered after the IV tPA treatment decision has occurred as long as the documentation is made prior to patient discharge (addendums cannot be made after discharge). Reason documentation must refer to the timeframe for thrombolytic therapy.   Suggested data sources: consultation notes, ED records, H&P, MAR, progress notes (exclusion: discharge summary).
